      CHAPTER I&mdash;THE STARTING-POINT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T falls to some to
      be born, as they say, with a silver spoon in their mouths, and the witty
      have made play with the thought that the wise child chooses rich parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam Branstone lacked the completeness of that wisdom. He was born in one
      of those disconsolate streets of Manchester down which the stranger,
      passing by tram along a main road, hardly more delectable than its
      offshoots, looks and shudders; but was born with this difference from the
      many&mdash;that he was son to Anne Branstone, a notable woman, and wisdom
      may be conceded him for the discrimination of his choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, however, it was Anne who gave him birth and started him in life, it
      was Mr. Councillor Travers who set him on his way from the mean street of
      his birth and started his career, and the circumstance which led to the
      intervention of Mr. Travers was due, not to Anne, but to the occupation of
      Tom Branstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam&rsquo;s father, Tom, was a porter at Victoria Station, Manchester, and there
      was just time between morning and afternoon school for young Sam to snatch
      a meal himself and to carry his father&rsquo;s dinner to him in a basin tied up
      in a bandanna handkerchief. In those days Victoria was an open station and
      a favourite dinner-hour lounge with boys from the neighbouring Grammar
      School. The attractions were partly the trains, partly the large automatic
      machines which delivered a packet of sweet biscuits in return for a penny.
      First one lunched frugally on the biscuits and pocketed the balance of
      one&rsquo;s lunch allowance to buy knives and other essentials, then one
      savoured the romance of a large station from which trains went to
      Blackpool and to the Yorkshire moors. Often one saw sailors on the through
      trains from Liverpool to Newcastle. One found secluded ends of platforms
      and ran races with luggage trucks. One was rather a nuisance, especially
      when one wrestled hardily at the platform&rsquo;s giddy edge and a train came
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam, as a porter&rsquo;s son, was on the other side of the fence. He did not
      lark at Victoria Station, and took his opinions of those who did from his
      father, adding, perhaps, a touch of jealousy against these chartered
      libertines who wore the silver owl upon their caps of dual blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day he had delivered Tom&rsquo;s dinner to him in the porters&rsquo; room and was
      retracing his steps down the platform when he saw two of the Grammar
      School boys emerge in a confused whirl of battle and sag, interlocked,
      towards the line, hopelessly unconscious in their struggle of an incoming
      train. They reached the edge, deaf to all warning cries, and long before
      help could reach them, fell over it in one entangled mass. One boy,
      aroused to a sense of their common danger, was on his feet nimbly enough
      and across the line to safety: the other, Lance Travers, stayed where he
      fell, with a leg broken against the rail. Wits left the first lad; he
      could only howl as the engine swept inexorably on, and adult help, though
      active, could not avail in time. Sam had no precise recollection of what
      followed, and certainly acted on impulse. He dived to the line and dragged
      the injured boy across, escaping death for both by the skin of his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, all was confusion: an ambulance; inquiries; names taken and so
      on; and Sam only came to himself when he discovered that he was being
      punished for arriving late at school. It struck him as unfair, but he did
      not realize that he was a hero till the evening paper told him so. He,
      Samuel Branstone, had his name in the paper! Glory could go no further,
      because those were the dark ages of journalism, before the photograph
      illustrated all, and to read one&rsquo;s name in print was then the apogee. We
      have moved since those dull days, when &ldquo;heart interest&rdquo; was still to be in
      vented.
    </p>
    <p>
      What profound satisfaction Anne Branstone found in that sober paragraph
      her son was not to know. She did not think it good for him to know, but
      she went about her house with softened eyes, and Sam heard her singing
      more than once; so per haps he may have guessed that she was pleased with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was more than she allowed Mr. Oscar Travers to guess, he was Lance&rsquo;s
      father, an estate agent with a good suburban practice, and Anne met him at
      the door in a way which would have marred Sam&rsquo;s future had Travers not
      known that Lancashire women are apt to be undemonstrative. She found a
      portly gentleman on the doorstep and thought he wore a patronizing air.
      They resent patronage in Lancashire.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, Travers had come to see what he could do for the lad
      who had saved his boy&rsquo;s life. That may be patronage, but he was thinking
      of it as the barest decency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;my name is Travers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a nice upset,&rdquo; she said, without inviting him to come in. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s
      your son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s doing very well, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh? Well, it&rsquo;s more than he deserves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not argue that. &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you would allow me to come
      in, or would you prefer me to return when your husband is at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s at home now. It&rsquo;s his early night. He&rsquo;s having his tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I return when he has finished?&rdquo; asked Travers with a nice
      tactfulness. He knew the curious delicacy against being seen eating by one
      of a superior class, as if that natural function were a deed of shame. But
      Anne was for short cuts and she never considered Tom&rsquo;s feelings overmuch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve owt to say,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better come in and get it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have something to say,&rdquo; said Travers, entering. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he added, as he
      caught sight of Sam, &ldquo;this is&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s him,&rdquo; Anne interrupted. She might have been identifying a criminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I shake your hand?&rdquo; he asked, and shook it heartily, ignoring Anne&rsquo;s
      muttered protest that the hand had not been washed for hours. &ldquo;I think
      you&rsquo;re a very plucky lad.&rdquo; He could have, said more than that, and felt
      that as an expression of his gratitude it was hopelessly inadequate, but
      Anne&rsquo;s eyes forbade effusiveness, and he wanted to propitiate Anne. He had
      something to propose which he had thought they would agree to rapturously,
      but was not so sure about the rapture now. For some reason, he had
      imagined that Sam would be one of a large family and was disappointed to
      find no evidence of other children about the room A large family would
      have made his proposal more certain of acceptance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any brothers and sisters, Sam?&rdquo; he asked; but Sam was tongue-tied, while
      Anne was silently but unmistakably asking Travers what business of his
      that was. However, Tom knew his place. Travers belonged with the tipping
      public, whose questions one answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has an elder sister, sir. Our Madge. She works out.&rdquo; She was, in fact,
      a general servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Travers felt his confidence ebb fast, both at this information and at
      Anne&rsquo;s austere disapprobation of Tom&rsquo;s communicativeness. He felt it was
      suggested to him that his visit was irrelevant, that Anne, this small
      woman, not uncomely, with her hands on her hips, and her black hair
      tightly combed into a ridiculous knob at the back, was, in fact, a rock,
      and that the impulses and desires of the two hulking men, Travers and Tom
      Branstone, would break in ineffectual foam against her adamantine
      resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glared formidably, hating a &ldquo;fuss,&rdquo; judging Travers, who had invaded
      her home for the purpose of making a fuss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Travers, marking time and hardly attempting to conceal his
      dismay. The longer he spent in Anne&rsquo;s presence, the more uneasy he became.
      She seemed to divine his purpose, and to be telling him silently what she
      thought of him for having such a purpose. He had, indeed, banked on a
      large family; porters, he had felt certain, were prolific, and you may
      subtract one child from a family of ten without much heart-burning,
      whereas an only son is a serious matter. But time brought no graciousness
      to Anne&rsquo;s attitude. She even ignored the sacred rites of hospitality;
      though tea was on the table, she had not asked him to have a cup. So he
      gave up temporizing and decided to broach his purpose at once, before Anne
      reduced him to complete incoherence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you know me already as Lance&rsquo;s father. I don&rsquo;t know
      whether you happen to have heard of me beyond that?&rdquo; Anne admitted
      nothing, and as it was to her he spoke, it did not matter that Tom, who
      had naturally spent a gossipy afternoon, was trying to signify that he
      realized the importance of Travers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an estate agent, if you
      understand what that means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne nodded grimly. &ldquo;Rent-collector said big,&rdquo; she defined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Travers, intending to suggest an amended definition and then
      thinking better of it. &ldquo;Well, yes. I&rsquo;m in the Council, too, you know.
      Well, now, Mrs. Branstone, I happen to be a widower and Lance is my only
      son. He means a great deal to me, and when I think how near I came to
      losing him this afternoon, how certainly I had lost him hut for the
      splendid presence of mind of this young hero here, I feel I owe a debt
      which I can never hope to pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Travers,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;least said is soonest mended, and debts that
      you can never hope to pay are best forgotten. It&rsquo;s a kindly thought of
      yours to come and look us up to-night, but I&rsquo;m not in the Council, and I&rsquo;m
      no great hand at listening to long speeches. By your leave, we&rsquo;ll take the
      rest as said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means, Mrs. Branstone, so far as expressing my thanks goes. But I
      have a suggestion to make. Lance, as I said, is my only son. He&rsquo;s a lonely
      boy, and he&rsquo;d be the better for a companion of his own age about the
      house. I was wondering if you would allow Sam to come and live with us? I
      should send him with Lance to the Grammar School, and I think I can
      promise that his future will be secured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam&rsquo;s heart gave a great leap. He, Sam Bran-stone, a Grammar School boy,
      one of the elect, the Olympians whose play he had envied from afar! He
      looked at Anne with glittering eyes, faint with hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Mr. Travers wants you to leave us. He&rsquo;s offering to
      adopt you as his son. Tell him the answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne never doubted that she was mistress of her house, and perhaps she did
      not doubt it now, but, for Sam, a child with the dreadful sensibility of a
      child, this moment when she demanded calmly, implacably, in the interests
      of discipline, that he should himself pronounce sentence on his soaring
      hopes was of a pitiable bitterness which brought him near the
      breaking-point. At one moment, to be raised to the heavens of ecstasy, and
      at the next to be cast down to the blackest hell of despondency; to be
      promised all, and to be expected to refuse! He was not more callous than
      any other child, and Anne knew perfectly well that a Land of Heart&rsquo;s
      Desire had been opened to him. It was not fair, and she knew that it was
      not fair, to ask him to speak the word of refusal; but she thought that it
      was good for him, and once she had, by her tone, if not by her actual
      words, indicated the reply which she required, she knew that he would
      suppress his leaping hopes and answer, in effect, that home, be it ever so
      humble, was home, and parents, whatever their status, were parents. He had
      a wild impulse to defy her, to tell her that he would come to see her on
      Saturday afternoons, that to wear the cap with the silver owl was the
      dearest ambition of his life, but he knew that it was hopeless. Even at
      such a moment as this, and with such an ally as Mr. Travers, he dared not
      challenge Anne. Her ascendancy was what it had always been, absolute. He
      shuffled unhappily and tried to meet Mr. Travers&rsquo; eye bravely, but
      succeeded only in looking up as far as the second button of his waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sam Branstone, hero, and fled, a heartbroken, tear-washed
      child, to hide his face and choke his sobs upon his pillow. And he was
      named for valour in the evening paper!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; repeated Anne, when he had gone, and added, anticipating argument,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a woman of few words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Travers knew he was fighting a losing engagement, but he had a shot in the
      locker yet, and a hardy determination not to be worsted by the likes of
      Anne Branstone. His pride was up, a pride which, over and above his
      benevolence and his sense of the fitness of things, would not allow him to
      regard the saving of his son&rsquo;s life lightly. Travers counted, the saviour
      of the son of Travers counted. He had offered to lift Sam Branstone in one
      way, and if they would not let him do it in that way, he would do it in
      another. Sam Branstone, willy nilly, was going to be lifted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he said, covering the retreat from his first position, &ldquo;that
      it is of no use pointing out to you the advantages which my proposal
      offers to your son?&rdquo; She shook her head. &ldquo;Come, Mrs. Branstone,&rdquo; he went
      on, conscious that it was no use and platitudinous at that, &ldquo;we all have
      to make sacrifices for our children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make them,&rdquo; said Anne curtly. It was true.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you will not make this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was thoughtful for a moment, and Travers began to hope that he was
      making an impression. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that it&rsquo;s Genesis twenty-two,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;but I disremember the verse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Genesis,&rdquo; he repeated, mystified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abraham and Isaac,&rdquo; she explained her allusion. &ldquo;Some sacrifices aren&rsquo;t
      looked for from us, and the Lord sent an angel to say so in those days,
      but I&rsquo;ve to be my own angel in these.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Abraham,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was going to sacrifice his son to the Lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, conveying her opinion of Travers, who had tried
      to &ldquo;come God Almighty over her,&rdquo; as she expressed it later to Tom. But
      Travers was not to be rebuffed. He had come to play Providence to Sam (and
      so far granted that her allusion was apposite), but his providence could
      compromise. He wasn&rsquo;t an absolute Jehovah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Sam may not be Lance&rsquo;s home companion,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;at least let them be
      school companions. Let me pay his fees at the Grammar School, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       He was going to add &ldquo;for appropriate clothes,&rdquo; but something in Anne&rsquo;s
      attitude told him that he had gone far enough, and he stopped short with
      the completion of his sentence in mid air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne believed in education. She wasn&rsquo;t convinced that a Grammar School
      education was superior, as education, to a Parish School, but its
      associations were. It gave a chance of &ldquo;getting on&rdquo; which transcended
      anything the Parish School could offer. It was a start in life which set
      one automatically above the lower rungs of the ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, but said it with a difficulty which Travers noted and,
      indeed, applauded. He was Lancastrian himself, and honoured her for her
      independence. He knew the mother-pride, the fierce individualism which she
      had subdued before she had consented to take a favour even for her son who
      earned it, and wasted no more words. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo;
       and, shaking hands, was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finish your tea, Tom,&rdquo; she said to her husband who had suspended
      operations during the interview. &ldquo;I want to clear away.&rdquo; She stood a
      moment pensively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a weak woman,&rdquo; she decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Branstone ate his tea, reserving judgment.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II&mdash;WHERE THE SHOE PINCHED
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Anne Branstone
      set her hand to the plough she ploughed deep, and it was not her fault if
      the harvest was not immense. But she did not misdirect her energy; she
      made certain that the seed was good seed before she harnessed her plough.
      To drop metaphor, she let young Sam prove that he was worth troubling over
      before she took trouble&mdash;trouble, that is, as Anne understood the
      word. Of course, she sent him &ldquo;decent&rdquo; to the Grammar School, and if that
      meant that she and Madge went without new spring hats that year, well,
      last year&rsquo;s hats must do. It was no great matter, and the greater pride
      swallowed up the less. Mr. Travers paid the fees, so that her son could
      associate with his, and Anne saw to it thoroughly that, in externals, Sam
      should be worthy to associate with Lance.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the beginning, and Sam, so far, was untried metal. Then, at the
      end of his first term, he came out top of his form at the July
      examinations, and, after that, Anne began to take things seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not pure ability which brought Sam to that proud eminence so much
      as the fact that he had been put in a form whose standard was really too
      low for him, and he had not worked over hard at lessons, being naturally
      preoccupied, in a first term, with finding his feet. Nor had that been too
      difficult. The Manchester Grammar School was a democratic institution.
      Schoolboys, anyhow, are not all snobs, and, in this instance, the presence
      amongst the paying boys of a leaven of Foundation Scholars, often from
      homes as poor as Sam&rsquo;s, made acclimatization easy for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his feat impressed Anne, though all she said, when the lists came out
      with the name of &ldquo;Branstone, S.&rdquo; at the head of II. Alpha, was, &ldquo;Of
      course!&rdquo; as if any other place were impossible for a son of hers; and it
      decided her that Sam would &ldquo;pay for&rdquo; taking trouble. She proceeded to take
      trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Branstone&rsquo;s first real inkling of what was passing in Anne&rsquo;s mind came
      to that good, easy man when he mentioned that his holidays were due in a
      fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take a holiday at home this year, my lad,&rdquo; she informed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why&rsquo;s that, Anne?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Blackpool&rsquo;s in the same place as it
      was, and I get privilege passes on the line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam&rsquo;s not in the same place, though,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s at the Grammar
      School. It&rsquo;s a place where other boys wear decent clothes, and I&rsquo;ll see
      that Sam shan&rsquo;t fall behind them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom took a holiday at home, varied with trips on the foot-plates of
      friendly engine-drivers, and fortified his soul with the consolations of
      tobacco. They were consolations which were not to be vouchsafed to him
      much longer. Tobacco cost money, and Anne had need of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of Travers&rsquo; generosity&mdash;or of as much of it as she could
      bring herself to accept&mdash;it was not an easy thing for Anne to keep
      her son at the Grammar School. It was desperately difficult, but Anne was
      Anne. The boy had his foot on the educational ladder, and she meant him to
      go to the top, rung by rung and scholarship by scholarship. When Sam took
      his honours degree at Oxford, Anne would relax; till then, she was a
      crusader. She sacrificed all to that ambition. Sam should have his chance,
      at no matter what cost to her, to Tom and to Madge. The boy must be as
      well dressed as his fellows, and he must play their games. Games are an
      essential part of English education, and Anne, with her constant eye to
      the main chance, recognized the importance of the playing-fields in
      cementing friendships with boys who might be useful to Sam in after life.
      But games are expensive, and Tom gave, up smoking when Sam was put into
      his class eleven. Anne gave up nothing. She had nothing more to give.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honestly, Sam was grateful. Anne did not boast to him of the sacrifices
      which they all made, but with the candour which distinguishes
      working-class homes where anything but bare necessity is exceptional, he
      was aware of every move, of all their deprivation, and did his best to
      square accounts. But it was not a brilliant best, and after that first
      term, Anne never repeated the satisfaction of seeing her son carry away a
      form prize on Speech Day at the Free Trade Hall. He was a worker, a safe
      plodding &ldquo;swot,&rdquo; taking by sheer application a respectable place in the
      lists, but never heading them again, and especially he was weak at
      mathematics.
    </p>
    <p>
      That troubled Anne distressingly. Mathematics appeared to her the
      corner-stone of education, though in truth they mattered little to Sam,
      who had followed Lance to the Classical side of the school, where
      mathematics were an unconsidered trifle. But Anne recked nothing of that.
      She had found the heel of her Achilles, and set herself to make that
      vulnerable place secure. You are to picture Anne, with her forty years of
      a working woman&rsquo;s life behind her, wrestling with algebra and
      trigonometry, blazing a trail for Sam to follow. It was heroic and, by
      some mental freak, successful. She taught herself, then tutored him, and
      it was not Sam who scraped through to an average place in the mathematics
      examinations, but Anne in Sam. Day after day, in the intervals of cook
      ing, cleaning, washing, she studied the text-books which so puzzled him,
      and at night explained their knotty points to him with a wonderful
      clarity. She had no education in particular, nothing but a general
      capacity and a monstrous will&mdash;a will that surmounted the obstacle of
      acquiring knowledge at an age when few can learn, and the greater obstacle
      of patient teaching to a boy who had a blind spot for mathematics. She
      illumined his darkness, but perhaps she hampered his classics and made her
      hopes of Oxford visionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly and painfully, as the terms went by, with Branstone, S. rising
      steadily in the school, but keeping regularly to his mediocre place in
      class, Anne acknowledged to herself that her goose was not a swan. It made
      her the more eager to cultivate what she called the social side; and
      through that she met with a defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the beginning, Sam&rsquo;s rise in the world had borne heavily on Madge,
      his sister, who was of an age for gaiety and of a mind untouched by
      ambition, personal or vicarious. When Sam went to the Grammar School,
      Madge was in service and very content. Anne had her out of that at once;
      she wasn&rsquo;t going to run the risk of Madge being the servant in the house
      of one of Sands school companions. It was unusual, but Madge preferred
      service, where she was lucky in her employers, to the weaving-shed, where
      she had free evenings, but strenuous days with no gossiping callers at the
      back door to break their monotony. And it became a considerable question
      in Madge&rsquo;s mind whether she would now be able to outface Anne in the
      matter of George Chappie. Anne required a presentable brother-in-law for
      Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Madge, George was unambitious, except that he wanted her, which was
      ambition of a kind. Madge was small, like her mother, but derived in most
      else from her father. She had freckles and carroty hair, and the makings
      of a querulous shrew, but George saw otherwise, and desired Madge to have
      and to hold, for better for worse, and didn&rsquo;t perceive that the odds were
      heavily against its being better. He was a wisp of a man himself, and
      thought he was enterprising because he was a window-cleaner;
      window-cleaning was a new trade then. But Anne did not concur with that
      opinion, and Madge was in no very sanguine frame of mind when George came
      in one night with an &ldquo;It&rsquo;s now or never&rdquo; look unmistakably in his eye. The
      trouble was that Anne was not the sort of mother one defied with impunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came in shyly enough&mdash;a determined George was a contradiction in
      terms&mdash;but plucked up courage at once when he found that she was
      alone but for Sam. Sam&rsquo;s presence was inevitable, but need not be
      acknowledged. In a house, not, indeed, of one room, but of one fire and
      one gas-jet, Sam had grown apt at insulating himself when he sat with his
      books at the table. The business of the house went on, so did Sam&rsquo;s
      studies, and neither interfered with the other. Sam, absorbed in his
      construe of Cicero&rsquo;s <i>De Senectute</i> for the morrow, was absolutely
      unconscious of Madge and George.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not Sam who troubled George, but Madge had truth with her when she
      told her suitor that he looked worried. George jerked his thumb vaguely
      streetwards. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s her again,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think why God made
      landladies. I ask you, Madge, is another blanket in this weather a thing
      to fly into a temper about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cold,&rdquo; said Madge. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t she give you another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet whether she&rsquo;ll give me one or not. But she&rsquo;s had my last
      word. Another blanket or I&rsquo;ll flit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve threatened that so often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He admitted it. &ldquo;I know. It takes an earthquake to shift some folks, and I
      reckon I&rsquo;m one of them. I stay where I&rsquo;m set.&rdquo; And his tone implied that
      conservatism was an admirable virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madge did not think so. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what my mother says of you,&rdquo; she observed,
      a trifle tartly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no lie, either,&rdquo; he placidly agreed. &ldquo;Seems to me,&rdquo; he went on, with
      a look, ardent but appealing, at Madge, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s only one thing will
      flit me from Mrs. Whitehead&rsquo;s. You couldn&rsquo;t give a guess at it, could
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I could,&rdquo; said Madge brazenly. After all, she was Anne&rsquo;s daughter,
      and direct. Then, despite herself, she fenced coyly: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re leaving the
      town, I reckon, Mr. Chappie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood aghast at the revolutionary thought. &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; he said earnestly.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m set here and I&rsquo;ll not leave willing. There&rsquo;s something to keep me
      where I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your job&rsquo;s not worth so much,&rdquo; she said, misunderstanding wilfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s steady, though,&rdquo; he defended it, &ldquo;and a growing trade. My master&rsquo;s
      getting a lot of window-cleaning contracts all over the town. But it&rsquo;s not
      my job that keeps me here. It&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He dropped his cap
      and fumbled for it nervously, somehow finding a sort of courage in the
      act, so that when he rose he faced her with a spirit which was, for him,
      quite debonair. &ldquo;Now, you&rsquo;ll not stop me, will you? I&rsquo;ve come on purpose
      to get this off my chest and I&rsquo;ve worked myself up to a point. I&rsquo;m a bit
      slow at most things and I&rsquo;m easily put off, so I&rsquo;ll ask you to give my
      humble request a patient hearing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madge looked at him acutely, and decided that his resolution was strong
      enough to survive something that she very much wanted to say. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather
      this didn&rsquo;t come straight on top of a row with your landlady,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; he agreed, &ldquo;I can see your meaning, but it&rsquo;s that that roused me to
      point. Love&rsquo;s like a pan of soup with me. It&rsquo;s got to seethe a while
      before it boils. But I&rsquo;m boiling now, and I&rsquo;m here to tell you so. I&rsquo;ve
      loved you since I saw you, Madge. After Sunday School one day it was, with
      a wind on that blew the bonny curls across your eyes. I always fancied
      gold and you&rsquo;re gold twice over.&rdquo; Madge was deeply moved at this
      idealization of her hair. She had been made more peevishly conscious of
      its redness than ever by the unsparing comments of the weaving-shed, but
      she did not see wherein she was gold twice over until he explained it. &ldquo;I
      didn&rsquo;t notice that the first day. I only saw your hair. I hadn&rsquo;t the nerve
      to come close enough to see the colour of your eyes. But when I did, and
      found them all gold-brown as well, that finished me. I was deep in love to
      the top of my head. Drowned in it, you might say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking a lot of nonsense, George,&rdquo; said Madge, with a fond
      appreciation that belied her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you I love you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m asking if there&rsquo;s anything
      that you could see your way to tell me in return. I know I&rsquo;m not smart,
      Madge, but I&rsquo;d work my fingers off to make you happy. Can&rsquo;t you say you
      love me, lass? Not,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;if it isn&rsquo;t true, of course. I wouldn&rsquo;t
      ask you to tell a lie even to oblige me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might not be a lie,&rdquo; said Madge softly, &ldquo;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She paused
      so that he was left to guess the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t care to go so far as to say it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He watched her timidly, with courage oozing out of him. She had all but
      given him to hope, but now it appeared she had no more to say. &ldquo;Well, I
      can understand,&rdquo; he said, half turning towards the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not much of
      a chap, and you might easily have put me down much harder than you did.
      It&rsquo;s soft letting now, by reason of your tactful ways. I&rsquo;ll... I&rsquo;ll go and
      see if Mrs. Whitehead has given me yon other blanket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was at the door before she stopped him. &ldquo;George!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;come back.
      You&rsquo;re getting this all wrong. You know about my brother.&rdquo; George nearly
      smiled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ud not be your mother&rsquo;s fault if I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I suppose everybody knows about his going to the Grammar
      School. They don&rsquo;t all know what it means.&rdquo; Madge was trying to be loyal
      to the family ideal, she was trying not to be bitter, but it wasn&rsquo;t easy.
      It was one thing to go without new hats and the accustomed ways of
      service, but another to go without George.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like you to understand that this family puts itself about a bit for
      Sam&rsquo;s sake. We think he&rsquo;ll go a long way up in the world, and the rest of
      us aren&rsquo;t doing anything to keep him down. None of us, no matter how it
      hurts. Are you seeing what I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not class enough for you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a part, but not the whole, of her meaning, and Madge wanted no
      misapprehensions. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re class enough for me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m telling
      you where the doubt comes in. It&rsquo;s a habit we&rsquo;ve got in this family. We
      think of Sam.&rdquo; That made the matter plain; she loved him, and while he
      granted there was a certain impediment through Anne&rsquo;s habit of
      subordinating everything to Sam&rsquo;s interests, he saw no just cause why he
      should not marry Madge. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t knowingly do anything to upset your
      mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve told you I&rsquo;m boiling with my love for you. I&rsquo;m
      easily put off my purpose as a rule. I mean to say, supposing I ask Mrs.
      Whitehead for a kipper for my tea, and she tells me eggs are cheap and
      she&rsquo;s got an egg instead, I don&rsquo;t make a song about it&mdash;so long as
      the egg&rsquo;s not extra stale. But I&rsquo;ll own I didn&rsquo;t think of Sam in this. I
      thought it was for you and me to settle by ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam&rsquo;s in it,&rdquo; said Madge dully. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in everything in this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Anne came in and the disturbance of her entrance, together with the
      fact that he had finished his passage of &ldquo;<i>De Senectute</i>&rdquo; made Sam
      aware that something was toward. He kept his eyes discreetly on his book,
      but fluttered the pages of his dictionary no more. He found youth more
      arresting than old age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne&rsquo;s quick comprehension took the situation in at once. She had been
      shopping, and as she put her parcels on the dresser she gave Madge the
      benefit of a wordless reproof. She could say a good deal without opening
      her mouth, and said it. But Madge was not going to be parted from her
      George without a fight. Sam apart, George was eligible, and Madge saw this
      as an unique occasion&mdash;the occasion for leaving Sam out. At least,
      she meant to try.
    </p>
    <p>
      George was turned craven at sight of Anne and sidled to the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
      getting on home, I think,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wait your hurry,&rdquo; said Madge hardily. &ldquo;Mother, George has been asking
      me to wed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the gage of battle, for Anne knew the fact already. The statement
      of it was a challenge. She met it coolly. &ldquo;Has he?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Well, I
      hope you told him gently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And at that George found his second wind of courage, and intervened like a
      man. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s told me nothing with her tongue. Nothing for certain. But a
      blind man on a galloping horse could read the thoughts of her. Mrs.
      Branstone, I love that girl as if she&rsquo;d put a spell on me. It&rsquo;s the
      biggest feeling that&rsquo;s come into my life, and I&rsquo;m full and bursting with
      it, or I&rsquo;d not have the face to expose my inside thoughts to you like
      this. And if you&rsquo;ll only tell me I can take her, the Mayor in his carriage
      won&rsquo;t be happier than me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know how steady George is, mother,&rdquo; Madge seconded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He needs to be,&rdquo; said Anne dryly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a window-cleaner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m steady by nature, Mrs. Branstone, as well as trade. I don&rsquo;t drink.
      Somehow one glass of ale is enough to make me whimsical, so I take none at
      all. I know I&rsquo;m being bowdacious in my love, but I&rsquo;m moved to plead with
      you. We&rsquo;d not be standing in Sam&rsquo;s way. We&rsquo;d live that quiet and snug
      you&rsquo;d never know we&rsquo;re in the town at all.&rdquo; Anne looked at him with a
      faint trace of appreciation drenched in her profound contempt. A poor
      creature, but he had his thimbleful of spunk! &ldquo;It would need to be quiet,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;with two to keep on your wage. Are you contented with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Disastrously, he was. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a regular job,&rdquo; he said, voicing his pride at
      being above the ranks of casual workers. In Anne&rsquo;s view, a hopeless case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a regular rotten job,&rdquo; she retorted, but spoke more softly than her
      wont. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve Sam to consider, Madge. You might live quiet, but Sam&rsquo;s
      brother-in-law has got to make a better show of it than to be seen all
      over the place at the top of a ladder like a monkey on a stick. I&rsquo;m not
      being hard on you, George Chappie, and I&rsquo;ve nothing against you bar that
      you&rsquo;re not good enough. You better yourself and you&rsquo;ll do. Stay as you
      are, and Madge&rsquo;ull do the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George opened his mouth to speak, but found that nothing came. It <i>was</i>
      a regular job, it satisfied his ambitions, and her objections were
      inexplicable. He had shot his bolt and, having no more to say, he went,
      relapsing to such invertebracy that when he found that Mrs. Whitehead had
      not added the other blanket to his bed he had nothing to say to her
      either, but spread a threadbare overcoat on the coverlet and shivered
      unhappily to sleep.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III&mdash;THE HELL-PIKE CLUB
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>O a schoolboy of
      sixteen, love is an imbecile emotion, its victims harmless lunatics, and
      it is not to be supposed that Sam&rsquo;s interest in the affair of Madge and
      George was based on intimate understanding. His conspiratorial action came
      rather as a lark: behind, perhaps, was the recognition that adults did
      habitually make fools of themselves in this way, that his loyalty in such
      a case was to Madge who was of his generation, and that Anne in
      obstructing their marriage was outrunning the constable in her demands for
      self-sacrifice on his behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Larking, defined as enjoyable interference with other people for motives
      either benevolent or purely egotistic, was a weakness of Samuel Branstone,
      and the boy was father to the man. He did not agree with Anne that the
      marriage was inimical to his interests. True, George cleaned windows and
      balanced hardily at the top of swaying ladders, a precarious trade, but
      his own. Apparently it suited the Georgian temperament, and that
      funambulist would not wear a placard on his back proclaiming that he was
      brother-in law to Branstone of the Classical Fifth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Branstone, who was going to rise in the world, would necessarily have poor
      relations, and it hardly mattered how poor. Indeed, the poorer they were
      the more cheaply he could afterwards play providence to them, since their
      standards would be low and their expectations small.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it wasn&rsquo;t a nice, impulsive lark, but coldblooded and calculated, which
      is almost as objectionable in a lark as organization in Charity. It is
      prudent good intentions that pave the way to Hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw that there was a difference between this and the elopements of that
      romantic literature with which he busied his relaxed hours: sometimes the
      lady, but always the lover, was enterprising, while he knew that George
      could never instigate anything. But that made things more amusing for Sam,
      who could pull strings with absolute assurance that his puppets would
      never take to dancing on their own account, or to any tune but the one he
      piped; and it is not given to all of us to be Omnipotence at the price of
      a ten-pound note.
    </p>
    <p>
      As always, Sam had luck. In the romantic elopements whose technique he
      began to study with new interest, money was never a difficulty, but the
      god in the machine of George Chappie&rsquo;s elopement must put money in his
      purse, or there could be no elopement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam liked money, but he must have liked power more, for, coming
      miraculously into money at this time, he devoted it to this end. He came
      into money because journalism was swiftly on the up grade since the days,
      four years ago, when it couldn&rsquo;t show its readers a photograph of Sam
      Branstone, hero, in the evening paper, and had reached the civilized stage
      of picture competitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      You bought a weekly paper which printed six crude wood-cuts supposed to
      disguise the names of (say) famous battles, and it did not strain your
      intellect to discover that the picture of a station with &ldquo;Waterloo&rdquo;
       beneath its clock was intended to represent the battle of that name. But
      pause: it was not all so easy as that. Inflamed by avarice and the
      childish ease of identifying the battles in the first series, you bought
      the next week&rsquo;s number, and the next, until the competition closed, and
      you found that the designs were increasingly baffling. It was not quite
      money for nothing. It called for some knowledge of history and a sort of
      knack in cheap wit to interpret the pictures. A garden syringe, and a
      stage Irishman brandishing something that might easily be a cudgel but
      wasn&rsquo;t, represented, in fact, the not very renowned battle of
      Seringapatam, and there were pictures which could bear two
      interpretations.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this last which led Sam to go into partnership with Lance Travers.
      Both partners admitted that Sam&rsquo;s wits were the sharper, so it was only
      fair that Lance should finance the partnership and buy the papers. And
      Sam, sanguine of winning, but desiring secrecy, preferred that the firm
      should be registered in Lance&rsquo;s name, so that if and when Sam became a
      capitalist, he and not Anne should control his wealth. His ideas of the
      uses of capital already went beyond the Post Office Savings Bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weekly paper&rsquo;s object was to increase its circulation, so it allowed
      and encouraged competitors to send in numerous attempts, and printed
      ambiguous drawings to tempt to prodigality. It is to be feared that
      Classics suffered an eclipse at this period of journalistic enterprise.
      The partners had other and more serious objects in life. And they won!
      They won the second prize. It wasn&rsquo;t a house or a motor-car or any of the
      fantastic prizes with which still later journalism rewarded its
      intelligent readers, but they divided twenty pounds and, for them, ten
      pounds each was paradise enow. Lance bought a bicycle. Sam didn&rsquo;t. He
      bought a wedding-ring, and he had a talk with Sarah Pullen, who was so
      passionately Madge&rsquo;s bosom friend that she had gone into the mill with
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarah received him coldly; she looked upon him as the cause of her
      friend&rsquo;s martyrdom and thought the cause unworthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam cleared the air at once. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on Madge&rsquo;s side. I&rsquo;m not going to see
      her made unhappy for my sake,&rdquo; he said, and Sarah relented so far as to
      absolve him of personal malignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much you can do to help it, though,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I <i>can</i> do much,&rdquo; he
      replied, &ldquo;but,&rdquo; he flattered her, &ldquo;perhaps you can do more. You see,
      Sarah,&rdquo; he went on confidentially, &ldquo;Madge trusts you and she doesn&rsquo;t trust
      me. Now, between ourselves, she needs a friend&rsquo;s advice. Put yourself in
      her place. Would you knuckle under to your mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d see her further first,&rdquo; said Sarah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;if you could see your way to communicating your
      views to Madge without mentioning that I suggested it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; said Sarah. &ldquo;You! It&rsquo;ud take a dozen your size to suggest anything
      to me. Get off home and play marbles, or I&rsquo;ll give you a slap on th&rsquo; 
      earhole that you&rsquo;ll remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They didn&rsquo;t play marbles in the Classical Fifth, but Sam was content to
      put her allusion down to ignorance rather than deliberate insult. He had
      gained his point: the atmosphere he desired created was about to he
      created.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left that pot to simmer and turned his mind to George, whom he judged
      less susceptible than Madge to the promptings of a friend. Besides, he
      knew no friend of George, and confessed himself at fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, shortly before the Whitsuntide holidays, he was staring gloomily
      out of the window at the top of the stairs outside the Fifth Form room,
      watching the boys of the Chetham&rsquo;s Hospital at play in that yard of theirs
      which the Grammar School pretends to scorn but secretly envies, when he
      heard behind him a conversation between Lance Travers and Dubby Stewart
      which set his brain awhirl. Yet it was not a distinguished conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who ever heard of anyone in Manchester staying at home in Whit week?&rdquo;
       asked Lance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam had heard, often.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t done,&rdquo; said Dubby, who had earned that abiding name when he was
      in the Lower Third, and once read &ldquo;dubious&rdquo; aloud with a short &ldquo;u.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve to do it,&rdquo; said Lance. &ldquo;My governor&rsquo;s too busy to get away. Bit
      damnable, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matter of fact,&rdquo; said Dubby, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not going, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it presently appeared that out of the form of twenty-four boys there
      were as many as six who lived in Manchester and were not going away. &ldquo;It
      will be hell,&rdquo; prophesied one of the unfortunates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It needn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Sam Branstone, turning from the window to the mournful
      group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re used to it. We&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; said someone cruelly, and Lance smacked
      his head. Allusions to anybody&rsquo;s poverty were bad form.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the prescription?&rdquo; asked Dubby, and Sam was silent for a minute.
      &ldquo;Watch him. Something&rsquo;s dawning,&rdquo; chaffed Dubby. It wasn&rsquo;t dawning, it had
      dawned; but at first it looked like a risk, and then much less like one,
      and Sam smiled beautifully as he realized that he, at least, had all to
      gain and nothing to lose. He drew the luckless five mysteriously aloof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prescription,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is to have a holiday in Manchester, in a
      holiday house.&rdquo; He let that soak for a minute, and then, &ldquo;Our own house,&rdquo;
       he added. &ldquo;There are six of us. We join together and we take a house. A
      small house, and I daresay some of you won&rsquo;t like the neighbours, but as
      the neighbours won&rsquo;t like us, that&rsquo;s as broad as it&rsquo;s long. Swagger
      neighbours wouldn&rsquo;t stand us anyhow, and the smaller the house the smaller
      the rent. Something like four-and-six a week is my idea. That&rsquo;s nine-pence
      a week for each of us, and we&rsquo;ve a house of our own for that to do what we
      like in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; said someone admiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we call it?&rdquo; said another, a trifle doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call it?&rdquo; said Lance. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s obvious. The Hell-fire Club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, of course, if any doubt remained, that settled it. Who would regret
      the seaside if he could be a member of the Hell-fire Club? Lance was
      commissioned to negotiate with his father, the estate agent, but it was
      Sam who really chose their house. It was a house which in Sam&rsquo;s opinion
      excellently suited the requirements of a young married couple of the
      window-cleaning class. Mr. Travers told Lance that he would stop the value
      of any damage out of his pocket-money, and on those conditions let them
      the house. But he need not have made that cautionary threat; Sam saw that
      there was no damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hell fire Club assembled for its initiatory debauch on the first day
      of the holidays, and by eleven a.m. three inexpert cigarette-smokers had
      had occasion to use the slopstone as a vomitorium. It left them feeling
      chilly, and Dubby suggested that a house-warming without a fire was a
      solecism, even on a hot day, so a lavish plutocrat brought in two sacks of
      coal and a supply of chips. Firelighting is a sport out of which a certain
      excitement can be derived, but only for a short time, and the same
      evanescent quality attaches to the pleasure of sitting on bare boards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too stiff to be happy,&rdquo; said Lance. &ldquo;I vote we furnish this club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carried, <i>nem. com</i>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, though,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;that I shall
      not be able to contribute much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till you&rsquo;re asked, my son,&rdquo; said Dubby. &ldquo;By the time we five have
      finished looting our homes, this place will be a little palace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loot is a brave word, suggestive of the treasures of the purple East, but
      it was, in most instances, a case of permitted loot, the offscourings of
      lumber rooms. Sandy Reed, however, was the sort of boy who is happiest
      with a hammer in his hand, and Dubby had an eye for chintz. To repair the
      veteran furniture which they brought struck Sandy as work for a man.
      Behind him was his infantile past of fret-work and model yachts; before
      him the foremanship of the Hell-fire Club repair-shop. He worked and was
      the cause of work in others. And it was willing work, partly because it
      was for an idea, partly because that first day had threatened boredom and
      here was something definite to do, mostly because it was making a noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ill-assorted chairs, tables and sofas which they collected under their
      roof had this in common at the end, that they were strong; and having by
      their own efforts made them strong, the boys did not by their rioting make
      them weak again. They respected their handiwork, and Dubby&rsquo;s chintz
      procured a sort of uniformity.
    </p>
    <p>
      A club, of course, must eat and drink, and kitchen utensils, mostly odd
      but all practicable, were gathered together that they might precede the
      pleasures of eating with the pleasures of cooking. It was camp-life in
      town, except that they went home to sleep, and so long as the activities
      of &ldquo;settling in&rdquo; endured, they relished it abundantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a fortnight was what Sam had mentally set as the life of the
      Hell-fire Club, and he had no intentions of paying the rent by himself for
      more than a week or so. They had decided that Sunday was not a club-day&mdash;there
      were difficulties at home&mdash;and Sam took George Chappie for a walk. &ldquo;I
      like this street,&rdquo; he said as they turned the corner. &ldquo;Madge always
      fancied this district.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she?&rdquo; said George gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go in here,&rdquo; and Sam produced the key and introduced George to the
      Club premises. &ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chintz took George&rsquo;s eye at once. &ldquo;By gum!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;This is where you&rsquo;re going to live when you&rsquo;re
      married to Madge. It isn&rsquo;t your furniture yet, but it&rsquo;s going to be. I&rsquo;m
      going to give it you for a wedding present. There isn&rsquo;t a bed in, as you
      see, but there will be, and I ask you, George, is it or is it not better
      than Mrs. Whitehead&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re going ahead a bit too fast for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Yours is the pace that kills. The slow pace, not
      the quick. Now, this place isn&rsquo;t at your disposal yet, but if you&rsquo;ll put
      up the banns next Sunday and get married as soon as you can after the
      three Sundays, you can walk in here and hang your hat up on that hook.
      It&rsquo;s a brass hook, George. We don&rsquo;t approve of nails in this house. I
      might mention that it will be all right about the banns. Mother has dinner
      to cook on Sundays and doesn&rsquo;t go to morning service, and to-day is
      father&rsquo;s Sunday off from the station and lie&rsquo;s on duty for the next three
      Sundays. So,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;there you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re promising a lot. Is this house yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rent is four-and-six,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;which isn&rsquo;t more than you can
      afford to pay. And you bind yourself to nothing by putting up the banns.
      If I fail to deliver you this house and all that&rsquo;s in it, you needn&rsquo;t get
      married. But I&rsquo;ve a word of advice for you, George. Let Madge hear of it
      first from the parson&rsquo;s lips in church. She won&rsquo;t scream and she won&rsquo;t
      faint. We don&rsquo;t, in our family, and it saves you the trouble of asking
      her. Is it a bet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George hesitated. &ldquo;Come upstairs and see the other room,&rdquo; said Sam. George
      saw, and marvelled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come round with you now to church,&rdquo; said Sam.
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just nice time to catch the clerk after service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gum!&rdquo; said George Chappie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it. They can&rsquo;t hang me. But,&rdquo; he
      added as he cast a last look at the household gods which Sam Bran-stone
      promised should be his, &ldquo;they may hang you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam grinned blandly.

      CHAPTER IV&mdash;THE COMPLEAT ANGLER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>E had succeeded
      with George beyond expectations, but that easy victory did not deceive him
      into thinking that his battle was won. Madge, he had said, would neither
      scream nor faint on hearing her banns announced and he wished he was as
      confident about it as he had sounded. Much, in his view too much, depended
      on the vigour of Sarah Pullen&rsquo;s advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was taking risks all round, but found he rather liked it. There was the
      risk that the Hell-fire Club would not tire of its toy in time. An
      encouraging increase in absenteeism amongst the members elated him, but
      the steadfast faith of an enthusiastic pair depressed him sadly. He hoped,
      however, to find a way out of that wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was the risk that some acquaintance of Anne&rsquo;s would mention the
      banns to her. He saw no way to counter that. It was a risk he had to take.
      Fortunately, his father&rsquo;s best friend, Terry O&rsquo;Rourke, was a Catholic.
    </p>
    <p>
      As things stood, he saw Madge as the weakest link in his chain. She
      collapsed before the will of Anne like an opera hat, and he was candidly
      afraid of her making a scene in church, either from pleasure or from
      anger, when the banns were read. Not that he shrank on principle from
      scenes, only that word of it would undoubtedly be carried to Anne and the
      fat be in the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rummaging one day that week at a second-hand bookstall in Withy Grove,
      without the slightest intention of buying, he was attracted by a title and
      recklessly planked his tuppence down. Intrigue, he felt, was punishing his
      finances, but this title gave him too good an opening with Madge to be the
      subject of economy. The title was &ldquo;The Clandestine Marriage,&rdquo; and he knew
      that Sarah Pullen would be in that night to see Madge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was reading the play very earnestly when she called, though it rather
      bored him and he thought its plot elementary compared with his own. Sarah
      was no reader, but she noticed the cover because the word &ldquo;marriage&rdquo; was
      an unfailing lure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever has the boy got hold of now?&rdquo; She inquired, taking his bait
      sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He showed her. &ldquo;Do you know what it means?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what marriage means,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By hearsay,&rdquo; he told the virgin pungently. &ldquo;But I meant the middle word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She eyed it closely. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always bragging your knowledge. I&rsquo;m not at
      the Grammar myself and Greek is Greek to me. Fat lot of good it&rsquo;ud be in a
      weaving-shed, and all.&rdquo; She had a practical mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t Greek,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s English.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the sort of English we talk in Manchester, choose how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till you&rsquo;re asked, cheeky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He didn&rsquo;t wait. &ldquo;It means surreptitious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a grand sight the wiser for that. It&rsquo;ll mean a thick ear for you if
      you don&rsquo;t stop coming the schoolmaster over me. I&rsquo;m here to talk to Madge,
      not to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He winked at Sarah with the eye which was hidden from Madge. &ldquo;The Secret
      Marriage, Sarah. That&rsquo;s what it means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sarah was interested now. &ldquo;Does it tell you how to work it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might do that myself,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk so foolish, Sam,&rdquo; said his sister. &ldquo;Are you coming for a walk,
      Sarah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; said Sarah. &ldquo;Now then, young Sam, spit it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t much. Only I happened to be out for a walk with
      George Chappie the other day and we went into a house that&rsquo;s pretty full
      of furniture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George Chappie with a house of furniture!&rdquo; cried Madge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s getting married,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;He courted you at one time,
      didn&rsquo;t he, Madge? I rather liked his taste in furniture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taste!&rdquo; cried Madge with spirit. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll taste him. I&rsquo;ll eat him raw for
      this. After all he said to me no more than a month ago, to take up with
      another wench! What&rsquo;s the hussy&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her name?&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see. Sunday to-morrow, isn&rsquo;t it? The banns
      might be up. If I were you I&rsquo;d go and find out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As true as I&rsquo;m alive I&rsquo;ll tear every hair from her head,&rdquo; said Madge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;You have red hair, but better red than bald.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her!&rdquo; said Sarah. &ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Sarah,&rdquo; Sam interrupted, and used a formula which he had
      thought out rather carefully. &ldquo;Do you imagine I&rsquo;d be giving you a message
      like this if he hadn&rsquo;t sent it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Message! What message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Anne came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sarah,&rdquo; she heard Sam saying with a pedagogic air. &ldquo;The word
      clandestine means secret.&rdquo; He resumed with zest the reading of his play
      and, though theirs was a small house, managed to avoid being alone with
      Madge up to church time on the morrow. He had business out that Saturday
      night&mdash;to make sure of George, whom he found full of panting
      resolution to catch the clerk and cancel the banns. The glamour of that
      furniture had lasted this long with George, but the awful hazard of the
      Sunday morning eclipsed the glow as it came nearer. George wilted at the
      thought of Madge rising in her place with a firm, irrevocable &ldquo;I forbid
      the banns&rdquo; upon her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had begun, too, to be a quality too much like that of an Arabian
      night about his visit to the Club. Sam was a wonderful boy and George
      granted his high superiority; but even George, the humble, did not quite
      see Sam as a miracle-worker. He even began to doubt the existence of the
      enchanted Palace which Sam had shown him, and that it was within Sam&rsquo;s
      competence to hand over that house to him appeared now ridiculous. Sam
      came just in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you care,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to have another look at your house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George would, but he hadn&rsquo;t time then: he was going; to see the clerk, and
      till he saw the clerk he was a man obsessed with an idea. &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he
      said sceptically, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s still there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;and has a few more things in since you saw it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a nice house, but I&rsquo;m going to see yon clerk to
      tell him not to put up banns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam smiled, relieved to know that he was not too late. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Madge is pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;Say that again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madge is pleased,&rdquo; repeated Sam brazenly. He was sure she was. He trusted
      Sarah Pullen now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she tell you so?&rdquo; asked George.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you imagine I&rsquo;d be giving you a message like this if she hadn&rsquo;t sent
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George took his cap off. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Sam, not defining what was so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The banns went up, and Sam was able to devote his undivided attention to
      Club affairs, as to which he had an idea arising out of the boredom he
      suffered while reading &ldquo;The Clandestine Marriage.&rdquo; That tuppence was a
      fruitful investment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wet day came and with it, what was now rare, a full attendance at the
      Club. But, since their repairs and decorations were complete, there was
      nothing to do except to sit on their reliable chairs and admire their
      reliability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a Hell-fire Club,&rdquo; said Sandy, &ldquo;we lack hellishness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lance named us,&rdquo; said Dubby. &ldquo;He ought to make suggestions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of a new name?&rdquo; asked Sandy. &ldquo;Call it the Eviscerated Emasculates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call it a damned failure,&rdquo; said another, and was sat upon. They welcomed
      the diversion, but the thought had reached home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter,&rdquo; said Sam, when order was restored, &ldquo;is that we aren&rsquo;t
      serious enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hell!&rdquo; said Lance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean it, Lance. We&rsquo;re not a set of kids from the Lower School. If we
      were, we might sit round and read Chums and the Boy&rsquo;s Own Paper.&rdquo; Two men
      of the Classical Fifth and the Hell-fire Club looked guiltily at him, but
      decided that he was not making personal allusions. &ldquo;As it is, we have
      higher interests. Now, there are six of us here and that&rsquo;s enough, with
      doubling, to take parts in a Shakesperian play. I vote we read a play. In
      fact, I brought some down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This suited Lance, who had aspirations towards the stage. &ldquo;Bags I Romeo,&rdquo;
       he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sandy was less fired to enthusiasm, but, &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you
      choose a play with lots of thick bits in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We certainly,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;shall not read an edition prepared for the use
      of girls&rsquo; schoofs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, then,&rdquo; said Dubby. &ldquo;Lance can spout Romeo
      out of his bedroom window to stop a cat-fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam would have preferred a tragedy; he feared they would enjoy reading The
      Merry Wives and so, on the whole, they did, but there were only five
      promises to turn up next day and two of those were conditional upon its
      being wet. Sam wasn&rsquo;t dissatisfied, and as a comedy was postulated chose
      <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i>, because he thought that it was dull in
      patches and also for a reason of his own. He wanted to make certain that
      he had nothing to learn as an intriguer from a famous case of
      match-making. He found he had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although it rained, <i>Much Ado</i> had only four readers at the opening
      and only two at the close. Lance sent postcards that night to the members
      announcing <i>Hamlet</i> for the morrow. He wanted to read Hamlet&rsquo;s part,
      but if you can&rsquo;t have <i>Hamlet</i> without the Prince, neither can you
      read it satisfactorily with one other participant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lance and Sam struggled through an act, then Lance gave in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting
      tired of this Club,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The members have no brain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t raining,&rdquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Lancashire&rsquo;s batting, too. Let&rsquo;s go and see Albert Ward and Frank
      Sugg at Old Tafford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next day, the Club was uninhabited, except by the ghost of Sam&rsquo;s broadest
      smile, its only tenant for a week. The freeze-out was accomplished, and
      its engineer had confidence enough to spend three pounds of his capital on
      a bed and bedding, &ldquo;to await instructions before delivering.&rdquo; Then he saw
      Lance Travers and pointed out to him that there were better uses to be
      made of ninepence a week than to waste it on a club which nobody used.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nuisance, though, about the chairs and stuff,&rdquo; said Lance, implying his
      agreement that the Club had failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have them back here, because I&rsquo;m turning our attic into an
      aviary. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve had no time to go to the Club,&rdquo; he explained with
      a faint apology, and took Sam up to see his birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we do about all that furniture at the Club? Pity the fifth of
      November is so far off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to think of something,&rdquo; said Sam, rather terrified at Lance&rsquo;s
      incendiary suggestion. &ldquo;In any case it must be discussed at a full
      meeting. Let&rsquo;s call the members together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An urgent whip resulted in a full and slightly shame-faced attendance.
      Nobody tried to dispute that the Club was a corpse: the only question was
      what to do with its bones. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;if none of you has a
      suggestion to make, I&rsquo;ll make one. Nobody&rsquo;s aching to take the stuff back
      where it came from. Now,&rdquo; he went on candidly, &ldquo;we <i>could</i> sell it to
      a dealer, but I&rsquo;m against that because dealers are thieves and they&rsquo;d give
      us about thirty bob for the lot. But my sister&rsquo;s getting married and I
      don&rsquo;t mind offering the Club five pounds for its property. That,&rdquo; he
      indicated, &ldquo;is a pound each for the five of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cash on the nail?&rdquo; asked Dubby, whose forebears came from Scotland. He
      distrusted Sam in the character of capitalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; explained the candid Sam. &ldquo;You see, when I met Lance yesterday
      I said I&rsquo;d think of a way out of the difficulty and I came prepared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I vote we take it,&rdquo; said Sandy. &ldquo;I can buy a lot of tools with a pound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why we should pander to your vices,&rdquo; said Lance. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re still
      a Club and this is club money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Club is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet. Not till we&rsquo;ve killed it gloriously on Sam&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s fiver.
      There&rsquo;s a hell of a bust in five pounds and we have to drink the bride&rsquo;s
      health. Champagne&rsquo;s my drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It wasn&rsquo;t, but it was rather too often his father&rsquo;s, and Lance was
      emulous, and, frightened a little of his own suggestion, carried things
      now with a rush. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re the Hell-Fire Club,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and champagne is
      the dew of Hell. Any member shirking will be held under the tap for half
      an hour.&rdquo; They braved it out, most of them conscience-stricken, and the
      Hell-fire Club almost deserved its name in the hour of its extinction.
      Things might have been serious had not Sam, by a well-timed push, caused
      Lance to shatter a full magnum on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was, five hangdog members reached home late, but presentable. But
      they were most unhappy boys. The sixth boy was happy. He had consumed a
      sober and interesting meal at other people&rsquo;s expense, encountering several
      delectable sorts of food for the first time and experiencing that human
      but reprehensible thrill which results from feeling that one is a clever
      fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Distance of course lent enchantment to the Hell-fire Club. When school
      reassembled and boys fresh from the seaside tried to excite the jealousy
      of the stay-at-homes with tales of land and sea, they were loftily put in
      their places and struck to dumb admiration by legends of the dashing vice
      of the Hell-fire Club. It lived in story as it had never lived in fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam visited the premises, on the day after the Club died, to wipe up the
      mess, thriftily to salve some untouched edibles for a coming
      wedding-feast, and by receiving and installing the bed to dedicate the
      house to better uses. Then he put the key in his pocket and took it to
      George. He had kept his bargain and now it was for George to keep his.
    </p>
    <p>
      There remained the question of Anne, and as a preliminary to its solution
      Sam had recommended Madge to look peaked. Madge, naturally inclined to
      that condition, had no difficulty in accentuating its appearance by
      recourse to the vinegar bottle until even Anne, intolerant as she was of
      small weaknesses, had to own that Madge looked unhappy and unwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the night before her wedding, Madge shut herself up in her bedroom
      whence the sounds as of a very ecstasy of woe penetrated to the kitchen.
      Yet her woe was not ecstatic and hardly woe at all. She wept because she
      was going to be married next day, because when one is going to be married
      next day one weeps. One brims with undefinable emotion and overflows into
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Anne, listening from the kitchen, where she sat with Sam, was moved to
      unaccustomed softness. &ldquo;That girl is fretting sadly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
      mort of trouble to be taking over a wastrel like George Chappie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Sam speculatively, &ldquo;I wonder whether you have ever
      considered the influence of matter over mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m considering the influence of something that does not matter,&rdquo; she
      replied. &ldquo;The influence of George Chappie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;suppose that George Chappie lived in a decent house
      of his own, with furniture that he took a pride in, instead of in those
      awful lodgings of his. Don&rsquo;t you think that he would live up to his
      surroundings? Don&rsquo;t you think that it would make a man of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George Chappie is as far from having a decent house as he is from wedding
      our Madge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;as far&mdash;and as near.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As near?&rdquo; asked Anne suspiciously. &ldquo;Sithee, Sam, have you been up to
      something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you hear me out if I tell you a story?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I going to like it?&rdquo; she fenced cautiously. &ldquo;I am hoping,&rdquo; he said
      piously, &ldquo;to have your forgiveness. It&rsquo;s a matter of happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He told her what he had done and how and why he had done it. &ldquo;The
      wedding&rsquo;s to-morrow,&rdquo; he ended, &ldquo;and I hope you&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo; He told his
      exploit without arrogance and without extenuation, and it is not to be
      supposed that Anne was unaware that a nice moralist would have found much
      in it to criticize, but Sam had come out on top and that, for Anne, almost
      excused his methods. It almost excused his coming out on top of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to the wedding,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll forgive them. They are no
      more than a pair of naturals in the hands of a schemer.&rdquo; Sam grinned
      appreciatively. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll not let you down so easy,&rdquo; she went on, and the
      grin faded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re clever, my lad, but you&rsquo;re a schoolboy, and the place
      for showing your cleverness is at school. It&rsquo;s too long since you brought
      me home a prize, and if you want my forgiveness for letting you rap my
      knuckles like this, you&rsquo;ll bring me a prize this Midsummer. Is that a
      bargain, Sam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always try,&rdquo; he said, which was true.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try harder,&rdquo; said Anne Branstone dryly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V&mdash;LAST SCHOOL-DAYS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>AM had not a dog&rsquo;s
      chance of winning the form prize of the Classical Fifth, and knew it. He
      learnt with difficulty, retaining what he learnt; but the process was slow
      and his form was overshadowed by the brilliance of two boys who learnt
      easily and rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It annoyed Sam to know that he had no chance against these two. Poetic
      justice cried out that he, the railway porter&rsquo;s son, should defeat Bull,
      whose father was a professor at the University, and Adams, son of a
      merchant prince whose &ldquo;Hong&rdquo; was as familiar in the godowns of Shanghai as
      his name in Princess Street and on &lsquo;Change; but it was hopeless. The prize
      lay inevitably between these two who took to classics like ducks to water
      and read Homer for (they said) pleasure, whilst their form-mates struggled
      with Euripides in acknowledged agony. They were both unpopular, both
      prigs, but unassailably pre-eminent; and they were two. Had it been a case
      of Bull alone, or Adams alone, Sam might have worked heroically on the
      off-chance, that his rival would be ill at examination time, but it was
      too far-fetched to hope that both would simultaneously ail.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had long passed beyond Anne&rsquo;s powers of tuition. It was not a &ldquo;sound
      commercial education&rdquo; that one got on the Classical side, and mathematics
      had ceased to figure in his course. He went to the Classical side because
      Lance was there and stayed because of Anne&rsquo;s golden dream of Oxford. The
      gold, she knew, was tarnished now, but if she no longer saw in Sam the
      winner of an open scholarship at Balliol, she had not abandoned hope that
      he might carry off one of the close scholarships which the School
      commanded. Sam himself was sceptical about even that qualified ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had to win a prize to satisfy Anne, and if he could not win the
      prize of which she was thinking, he would try to win one of which she did
      not think. It was certainly a prize, and a handsome prize, open not only
      to a form but to the whole school&mdash;a prize for reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a secondary spur, too, in the fact that Lance, that ardent
      elocutionist, looked on this prize as his own, and the thought of beating
      Lance on his chosen ground tickled Sam&rsquo;s fancy. Not that he was cocksure.
      He knew his handicap too well for that, but he had always known it, and
      from the first day of his school life studied to correct his accent. He
      did not, even now, even at the price of being thought pedantic, indulge in
      slang. Lance, perhaps because he came from a motherless home, perhaps from
      a stupid bravado, larded his speech with silly blasphemies and the current
      vulgarisms, and, in fact, he did it with an air; but Sam had to guard his
      tongue. There is a difference, too easily detected, between correct slang
      and incorrect English: one must first speak correctly before one can dare
      successfully to be incorrect, and Sam&rsquo;s handicap was that he came from a
      home where they used, in Sarah Pullen&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;the sort of English we
      speak in Manchester;&rdquo; the other sort was an alien tongue and held to be an
      affectation of the insincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a set piece&mdash;the opening speech in <i>Comus</i>&mdash;the
      inefficients were weeded out, and the elect tested on &ldquo;unseens.&rdquo; It was
      the &ldquo;unseens&rdquo; that frightened Sam: he rehearsed <i>Comus</i> till a
      misplaced aitch was a physical impossibility, and he was sure of his
      rhythm and the intelligence of his rendering; but he knew that aitches
      were elusive when he was nervous. &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t be nervous,&rdquo; was counsel of
      perfection: the ordeal of the &ldquo;unseen&rdquo; test intimidated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he practised, and did not spare himself. If sweat and blood would win
      that prize, Sam would spend both. He read aloud by the hour&mdash;classics
      of course suffering&mdash;with a pin in his hand with which he resolutely
      drew blood at every aitch he dropped; and in his reading he was fortunate.
      He read <i>The Spectator</i> which he had borrowed by pure chance from the
      school library, and the judges handed him a passage from <i>The Spectator</i>
      to read at the unseen test, and one of the great speeches of Marlowe&rsquo;s <i>Tamburlaine</i>,
      whose thundering music had so much attracted Sam that he knew the purple
      patch by heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He won the prize; staggered across the platform of the Free Trade Hall
      with a Gibbon in six sumptuous volumes, calf-bound, stamped with the
      school arms; he rode &ldquo;in triumph through Persepolis,&rdquo; and thought that it
      was &ldquo;sweet and full of pomp;&rdquo; then, when it was over and the last
      &ldquo;Gaudeamus&rdquo; of that Speech Day had been sung and the last cheers for the
      holidays (always the heartiest) been given, he sought his mother in the
      crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Sam, who had kept this glory as a surprise for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;but it might be better. You&rsquo;ve won a prize and you&rsquo;re
      forgiven, but you know well enough that you&rsquo;ve diddled me. I wanted a
      prize to show that you&rsquo;d the gift of learning, and you&rsquo;ve won one to show
      that you&rsquo;ve the gift of the gab. I knew it already,&rdquo; she ended dryly, &ldquo;and
      you&rsquo;re nobbut tenth out of the twenty-four in your class. Will they move
      you up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dissembled the genuine pride with which she had seen him cross that
      platform and take his bulky prize, because she felt inly that the chief
      talent Sam had proved was a talent for deception. This was a prize, but
      she thought it too barely within the meaning of the act: it observed the
      letter of his bargain and eluded the spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did him less than justice. The average hoy came to school knowing
      English; Sam had had to learn it, and here was proof, in a prize won
      against the whole school and not merely against a form, that he had
      learned his lesson well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her disparagement depressed him. He had not reached, and with a mother
      like Anne he could not at his age reach, the healthy younger generation&rsquo;s
      contempt for the opinions of its elders. He felt weakened in his belief in
      the social and economical value of a decent accent and grew careless in
      preserving it. His Gibbon lay upon his shelf unread, an empty glory, and,
      in the event, his prize was to lead to a calamity. It was to lead,
      indirectly, to Tom Branstone&rsquo;s death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam found himself, after the holidays, moved up to the Transitus, the last
      boy to be moved there from the Fifth. He was not sure that it pleased him.
      Left in the Fifth he might have been a Triton among the minnows: in the
      Transitus he was incurably a minnow. But he discovered there an atmosphere
      to which he might have responded better than he did. Discipline was
      slacker; one had reached the ante-room to the Sixth and was assumed to be
      serious; one had the privilege of a form-room which was open in the
      lunch-hour so that one had not to wait with smaller fry in the corridors;
      and, above all, the form-master was a gentleman as well as a scholar.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not blind to these advantages, but he did not, somehow, &ldquo;come on&rdquo;
       with his classics. The terrible facility of Bull and Adams was a constant
      discouragement: mere perseverance was outvied by natural ability and
      dragged its leaden weight behind. He knew himself incapable of shining in
      this company, and gave up a losing fight the more readily because the
      half-term brought a new diversion, and a chance to coruscate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was cast, as winner of the reading prize, for the Christmas play. He,
      Sam Branstone, was to act Shylock at the Conversazione, whilst Lance
      Travers was given Bassanio&mdash;salt on the still bleeding wound of his
      defeat. Greek Tragedy interested Sam no more. He saw Irving&rsquo;s Shylock from
      the gallery of the Theatre Royal, and, for comparative purposes, Benson&rsquo;s.
      He haunted Cheetham Hill, observing Jewish &ldquo;types.&rdquo; He came to the first
      rehearsal, like any other novice, knowing every line of his part&mdash;and
      had painfully to unlearn and relearn under the direction of the brisk
      little mathematics master who took the play-in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne screened her pride in this distinction. Play-acting was, in any case,
      questionable, too newly come to respectable estate to be accepted
      unreservedly. But, in secret, she determined that she would be one of
      Sam&rsquo;s audience and Tom another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parents were invited to the Conversazione&mdash;that was what
      conversaziones were for&mdash;but Anne and Tom had never accepted the
      invitation before. It implied evening dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      She decided that she could &ldquo;manage&rdquo; with her Sunday dress and two yards of
      lace; but Tom, too, must be there, and Tom must not shame Sam. She thought
      she saw a way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do it, lass. I&rsquo;d never dare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have thought of that before you became Sam&rsquo;s father,&rdquo; she
      replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see him and I&rsquo;ll none go alone. You&rsquo;re coming with
      me. I reckon Mr. O&rsquo;Rourke will be in to-night as usual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Tom, suspecting nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      One basis of his friendship with O&rsquo;Rourke was that their evenings off
      happened to coincide, Tom&rsquo;s from Victoria Station and Terry&rsquo;s from the
      old-fashioned commercial hotel in Mosley Street, where he was an
      institution. Terry was a waiter, but Tom had not yet seen the connection
      between his friend&rsquo;s profession and the Grammar School Conversazione. He
      was never very bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terry had a hard head and a professional style, rather like a successful
      doctor&rsquo;s bed-side manner, which wheedled more tips from commercial
      travellers than they gave at any other hotel in their rounds, but he had a
      sunken vein of poetic superstition and, when Anne interrupted them, he was
      explaining to Tom that he tolerated the Royal Hotel because he could see
      from its window the green of the grass outside the Infirmary. Manchester
      was Manchester because it lacked grass. The &ldquo;good folk&rdquo; couldn&rsquo;t dance on
      granite sets: only on grass did one find fairy-rings and only where grass
      abounded were people blessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not be wanting your dress-clothes next Wednesday night, I reckon,&rdquo;
       said Anne, breaking in without apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, Mrs. Branstone,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Wednesday&rsquo;s the night when I dress
      like the public. I&rsquo;ve gone into a strange hotel and been mistaken for an
      ordinary customer on a Wednesday night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll maybe not object to lending Tom your clothes next week. I
      want him to be mistaken for a swell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a shine on them,&rdquo; objected Terry, &ldquo;that you can see your face
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dress-clothes,&rdquo; pronounced Anne, &ldquo;are dressy when they shine. If you&rsquo;ll
      put studs and a clean shirt in with them, I&rsquo;ll be obliged, and I&rsquo;ll send
      the shirt back washed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Anne&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; protested Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hold your hush,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s settled. Go on about the fairies,
      Terry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fairies seemed to Anne entirely suitable as a subject of conversation for
      those children, men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terry brought the clothes himself and personally assisted at Tom&rsquo;s
      transformation from a railway porter into a &ldquo;swell.&rdquo; His tie, at any rate,
      was nicely tied, but &ldquo;I feel the awkwardest fool alive,&rdquo; said Tom, as well
      he might, with clothes which fitted where they touched; Anne, had she
      confessed her inward sinking, must have admitted that she was in no better
      case herself, but confession was far from her: she had to be brazen for
      two. Yet even Anne&rsquo;s high courage failed her in the ladies&rsquo; dressing-room:
      she emerged so humbled by the splendours which she had seen unveiled that,
      at a word from Tom, she would have turned tail and fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Tom had found countenance. Mr. Travers, meeting him on the stair, had
      taken charge of him, and now added Anne to his convoy. It was kindly tact
      increased to the power of heroism: he talked hard and sheltered his waifs
      from feeling the curious glances which, even in that mixed company, were
      directed embarrassingly at them. He ignored a quiet, well-known alderman,
      who obviously wanted to speak to him. He shepherded them to their places
      in the Lecture Theatre, sat with them and accomplished the incredible feat
      of putting Tom Branstone at his ease in the midst of the tipping public.
    </p>
    <p>
      Travers acquired more merit that night than by all his payments of Sam&rsquo;s
      school-fees: and Sam himself did nobly, not only on the stage whence he
      acted at Anne and bowed to Anne, but afterwards when, still in his
      costume, he paraded with her, drank coffee with her, and met with
      Shylockian hatred any eye which seemed to hint that he had not tremendous
      reason to be proud of his little mother. And what he did for her, Lance
      and Mr. Travers did for Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undoubtedly, a huge success: a night of nights, carved on the tablets of
      memory in letters of gold: never, not by so much as a dubious hint, to be
      associated with the illness of Tom Branstone. That was, of course, caused
      by overwork at Christmas at the station. It had and could have nothing to
      do with the fact that Tom, coming in ecstasy from the heated school into
      the cold December night, presently threw off his overcoat and danced
      exulting on the pavement: conduct so utterly unprecedented, so wholly
      un-Tom-like, that he had footed it merrily for ten minutes before Anne
      recovered enough command of him to put an end to the discreditable
      performance. Besides, for five of the ten minutes, she had danced hand in
      hand with him. She, too, exulted, but neither of them ever referred to
      their pagan capering again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Tom! He had not had so many nights of triumph in his life that this
      should be his last, but he was soon to start upon a journey from which
      even Anne&rsquo;s imperious will was powerless to call him back. She helping
      him, he struggled hard against pneumonia and made a better fight with
      death than he had ever made with life, but his course was run and the
      school had not reopened after the holidays when Tom Branstone ceased to
      fight. It seemed that, on the night of the Conversazione, he had had his
      hour, and
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      &ldquo;men must endure
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Their going hence even as their coming hither:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ripeness is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not come to Sam as the shattering of his world&mdash;only the death
      of Anne could have done that&mdash;but certainly as a stunning blow. It
      was the first time that he had come intimately close to death and he
      missed death&rsquo;s beauty and its peace. He saw too well its ugliness and the
      detail of a burial. It hurt, not because Tom Branstone had had but little
      joy in life, but because he died too soon to see the glory of his son. In
      after years, Sam Branstone would have liked to recall how Tom&rsquo;s death
      softened him, how he melted to tears before that waxen face and lovingly
      bought flowers to put inside the coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wouldn&rsquo;t do. It didn&rsquo;t fit the facts. He knew that, honestly, he had
      been angry with his father for dying, especially for dying in the
      holidays. It spoiled the holidays and it robbed Sam of the day&rsquo;s holiday
      he would have had for the funeral had Tom had the gumption to die in
      termtime. He resented his father&rsquo;s death as he would have resented an
      unjust thrashing from him&mdash;if Tom Branstone ever thrashed anybody.
      Tom had died prematurely, while he was still useful to Sam. He had bilked
      Sam, and Sam was angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only had Tom died too soon to see the glory of his son, but his son&rsquo;s
      glory was seriously jeopardized by the breadwinner&rsquo;s death. Sam had, in
      his innermost soul, given up the idea of Oxford; he was not apt enough at
      classics, but he was far from admitting it now. It was Tom&rsquo;s death, and
      that alone, which deprived him of that crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne felt it deeply. She had loved Tom with something like mother-love as
      well as wife&rsquo;s. If she had been hard with him, it was for his good, and he
      as well as she had known that her hardness was like the hardness of a
      crab&rsquo;s shell, hiding a tender place inside. Now that he was dead she could
      hide her grief as she had hidden her love, and went about her business
      soberly. Soberly she drew her money from the Sick and Burial Society and
      soberly she spent it on &ldquo;black&rdquo; for Sam, for George, Madge and herself,
      doing those things which Tom would have expected to be done to dignify his
      death, but adding nothing that would make his funeral a neighbours&rsquo; 
      raree-show.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came back from the cemetery with dry eyes and soberly presided at the
      inevitable meal (where she had to comfort a lachrymose O&rsquo;Rourke) and, on
      the morrow, soberly set out to visit Mr. Travers, and to tell him that, of
      course, she could not now keep Sam at school. It was little that Travers
      was allowed to guess from this stoic that this was the end of her dream
      for Sam, that with Tom&rsquo;s death the underpinnings of her world had flopped.
      And her pride stood where it stood five years ago: no more now than then
      would she accept from Travers money to pay expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head defiantly. &ldquo;The lad&rsquo;ull have to work,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Travers knew adamant when he saw it. &ldquo;Then, at least, let him come here
      and work in my office.&rdquo; Anne almost glared. &ldquo;I want a fair field and no
      favour. He&rsquo;ll have to start as office-boy, with the wages of an
      office-boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hardly that, Mrs. Branstone. Remember, he comes to me from the
      Classical Transitus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and much use that is to an estate agent. He can&rsquo;t add up
      a row of figures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had no delusions about the practical value of a public school
      education.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, though, that we must let it count for something,&rdquo; he replied,
      and Anne, compromising against the grain, consented to let it count for
      fifteen shillings a week &ldquo;until we see,&rdquo; added Mr. Travers, &ldquo;how he
      shapes.&rdquo; He intended to see very soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne nodded grimly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see he shapes,&rdquo; she said, and Sam, silent
      witness of this pregnant interview, was hardly surprised by Anne&rsquo;s first
      words on reaching home. &ldquo;Get out those old arithmetic text-books of
      yours,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and look up mensuration. I&rsquo;ve not forgotten it, if you
      have.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VI&mdash;THE NEST-EGG
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>OM Branstone had
      drawn a wage of a pound a week, and tips may have averaged ten shillings
      but more probably did not; your sixpenny tipper is a rare bird in
      Manchester.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Anne had saved steadily, and she had not allowed a life-long habit to
      be interrupted by a little thing like the necessity of providing Sam with
      Grammar School books and clothes. I do not say that it was admirable in
      her, but merely that it was heroic. It was an incredible feat, but it can
      be done: it is done every day by people for whom the word &ldquo;thrift&rdquo; has
      meaning. Perhaps they are often unlovely in their lives or perhaps they
      have the robust satisfaction of those who live for an idea: opinion has
      always differed as to whether what they do is worth doing, and modern
      opinion inclines strongly to the belief that it is not. Life to these
      iconoclasts seems more important than the means of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Anne it seemed abundantly worth while, and the proof was here now when
      she found that the interest on her savings amounted to three and
      four-pence weekly. They could live on Sam&rsquo;s earnings and Anne&rsquo;s &ldquo;means&rdquo;
       without pinching. Her forethought made all the difference now between too
      little and enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, of course, only to Anne that this seemed enough: Sam took a larger
      view, but found his vision cramped for some time to come by the conditions
      he met with in Mr. Travers&rsquo; office. Certainly that generous soul did not
      mean to humiliate Sam; he did not mean Sam to begin as office-boy; but,
      whatever his intentions, the clerks in his office defeated them. Sam was a
      newcomer, the latest arrival, in a minority of one against the old
      inhabitants; was there, moreover, obviously to do as he was told. He was
      told to sweep the floor in the morning, to copy letters and to lick
      stamps. He did these things rebelliously, bitter at heart that such menial
      service should be required of an ex-member of the Classical Transitus,
      certain that there was some mistake, that he had only to catch Mr.
      Travers&rsquo; eye when he was so shamefully occupied for that gentleman to take
      instant and drastic measures with the clerks who misemployed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Travers&rsquo; eye, even though caught at what Sam thought an opportune
      moment, While Sam copied letters, unexpectedly failed to disapprove. He
      seemed less preoccupied with Sam&rsquo;s affairs than Sam was. As a matter of
      fact, he took a long distance view of Sam, and took it, unfortunately,
      rather muggily. Travers had the defect of his quality. A generous man, he
      was generous in the worst way to himself, and Sam soon learnt the meaning
      of a euphemism, current in the office, &ldquo;Mr. Travers is attending a
      property auction.&rdquo; Property auctions are, it is true, usually held on
      licensed premises, and whether Mr. Travers was or was not attending an
      auction he was certainly on licensed premises more often than was good for
      either his business or himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was bad for Sam, not because it left him to find his own feet in
      the office and to fight unbacked with his superiors (wherein, indeed, it
      was good), but because he had figured Travers from afar as a princely
      gentleman, without reproach, and the discovery of his failing took Sam a
      long way on the road to cynicism. In youth one&rsquo;s faith dies hard, and,
      being dead, turns rapidly corrupt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The business was an excellent one, rotting slowly from the top, and Sam
      found the office a notable place in which to pick up knowledge of the
      world; especially, since he lacked good direction, of the shadier ways of
      the world. He felt that he had declined in status: his school-friends,
      there his equals, had gone either to the Universities or, with influence
      behind them, to the professions. If they went to business, it was as their
      fathers&rsquo; sons. They were not scratch men, and Sam felt that he was
      starting at the scratch-line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Travers had really no intentions that Sam should feel himself misprized.
      The boy had to learn the business, and the way to understanding lay from
      the bottom upwards. But Sam contrasted himself bitterly with Lance, first
      at school and then at Cambridge. In that, indeed, he found a minimum of
      consolation. It wasn&rsquo;t rational, but to Anne and consequently to Sam,
      university had meant Oxford, and he won a hardy solace from the thought
      that Lance was, after all, &ldquo;only&rdquo; at Cambridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, he grew in knowledge of his world, and education came to Sam,
      not in the cloistered freedom of the Isis, but where, in Manchester, he
      went collecting rents: in country courts where hard laws operated hardly:
      and in the office, where men did not greet each other with a friendly
      smile, but gave instead the &ldquo;competition glare.&rdquo; It was not a kindly
      school in which he spent the developing years, but one where it was taught
      that self&rsquo;s the man, and magnanimity is a mistake. &ldquo;Get on or get out,&rdquo;
       and Sam got on with a sort of choleric zeal which gave no quarter and
      expected none.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not get on fast enough to please himself. He had, he thought,
      stepped down from the days of the Grammar School where he belonged with
      the caste that rules or, at any rate, administers, the caste that sits on
      velvet and overlooks the mob. Now he was in the cockpit, with the mob that
      struggles to ascend, and, to Sam, a wage of thirty shillings a week at the
      age of twenty was a derisory ascension. Anne thought it satisfying, and it
      was her contentment with his rate of progress which first made him begin
      to think of her as, after all, a limited person. You didn&rsquo;t bribe Sam
      Branstone to be meekly satisfied with thirty shillings a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trouble is,&rdquo; he said to the only man in the office with whom he was
      in the least confidential, &ldquo;that you don&rsquo;t begin to get on till you&rsquo;ve got
      a bit of capital together. Money breeds money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His friend suggested betting as a means to affluence, and offered to tell
      him of a dead certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam assumed his cunningest air of a superman of the world. &ldquo;The best row
      of houses where I go for the rents,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;belongs to Jack Elsworth,
      the bookie. I don&rsquo;t see why I should help him to buy another house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bookies don&rsquo;t always win,&rdquo; said the optimist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible to make money out of betting and it&rsquo;s
      possible to get a baby by a harlot, but that isn&rsquo;t what the harlot&rsquo;s for,
      and it isn&rsquo;t what the bookie&rsquo;s for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this time, harlots were the pegs on which Sam hung his wit. He had no
      other use for them, but had discovered that a coarse turn of phrase was an
      asset in his world and therefore wielded it. But the effect of this little
      conversation was to crystallize his aim. He wanted that &ldquo;bit of capital&rdquo;
       badly, and did not intend that, if opportunity presented, a nice regard
      for scruple should hold him back from taking anything the gods might send.
      He had no ultimate design, but fortune came to the fortunate and money to
      the moneyed, so that the first move was, obviously, to get money. He
      wanted a jumping-off place; then he would soar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opportunity walked into the office in the person of Joseph of Arimathea
      Minnifie. That was his full baptismal name: analogous with the styles of
      certain limited companies, such as John Smith ( of Newcastle) Limited, to
      distinguish that Smith from other Smiths. Minnifie&rsquo;s mother had explained
      to the parson that she was a New Testament woman. To her intimates she had
      put it that she chose the name Joseph because she liked it, but she also
      liked a man to be a man. It was deduced that she supposed the third Joseph
      in the Bible would have acted differently from the first in the affair of
      Potiphar&rsquo;s wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam&rsquo;s accent had degenerated since the days of Shylock and the reading
      prize. It had kept bad company, and might be known by the company it kept
      to-day rather than by that which it used to keep at school; but he could
      still, without too great an effort, assume a well-bred speech and was
      often sent with a prospective buyer to show off any likely houses on Mr.
      Travers&rsquo; list. Because it was usual for him to go on such errands, and not
      because anyone supposed that niceties of speech could or would have any
      effect on Mr. Minnifie, he was sent with him in a cab to tour the suburbs
      where Travers had property in charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      A coarse accent was not likely to offend Joseph Minnifie, who a fortnight
      earlier had been a market porter at Shude Hill, but had now come into
      money, well invested in the best Brewery securities, from his uncle, a
      publican. Minnifie had sold out some of the shares because he could now
      satisfy a long ambition and live in his own house. He proposed, he told
      Mr. Travers, to retire to the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The country?&rdquo; asked Travers, whose practice was suburban.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Minnifie, &ldquo;summat quiet and homely. I&rsquo;d like a change from
      Rochdale Road. I thought,&rdquo; he went on rather shyly, &ldquo;of Whalley Range.
      It&rsquo;s a good neighbourhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Travers refrained from pointing out that Whalley Range was not usually
      regarded as the country, but was, in fact, of the inner ring of suburbs, a
      penny tram fare from the centre of Manchester. &ldquo;Oh, yes, Mr. Minnifie,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I think I can satisfy you in W&rsquo;halley Range. I have several
      available houses on my books in that district.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay three hundred pound for what I like,&rdquo; said Minnifie, quite
      fiercely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it in my pocket now.&rdquo; He was fierce because he was not
      yet quite sure that his legacy was not phantom gold, and he pulled out a
      bundle of notes as much to assure himself that they were still where he
      had put them as with the idea of proving his good faith to Travers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Travers concealed a smile. After all, commission on three hundred pounds
      is not to be sneezed at, but neither was this the sort of client for whom
      Traver&rsquo;s disturbed his habits. &ldquo;I have myself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a large property
      auction to attend in the city, but Mr. Branstone will go with you to
      inspect the houses.&rdquo; He smiled kindly on Sam, and added, lest Minnifie
      should think his affair, so important to him, underrated by the agent:
      &ldquo;Mr. Branstone is my confidential man. When Mr. Branstone tells you
      anything about the houses you are going to see, it is as if I spoke
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Minnifie. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s your foreman, and you needn&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;ll
      back him up. I know foremen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, his word is certainly as good as mine. I leave you in safe hands,
      Mr. Minnifie.&rdquo; And Travers went out to attend his first auction of the
      day, which usually happened at eleven o&rsquo;clock in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam and the client took a cab to Whalley Range, where Minnifie inspected
      several houses which were to be had at about his price. But he was hard to
      satisfy, and, what was worse, apparently unable to define his reasons for
      dissatisfaction. As Sam praised this and that about a house, Minnifie
      admitted that such things were praiseworthy, but he would, please, see
      another house. Sam was a little piqued and tried his best to be genial,
      suspecting that Minnifie resented being fobbed off with a &ldquo;foreman&rdquo;; and
      Sam&rsquo;s best was very good, so that presently the ice was thawed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Minnifle stood at the bow-window of a dining-room and looked up and down
      the street. It was empty save for a tradesman&rsquo;s boy. From somewhere round
      the corner came the diminished rattle of a milk-cart. Minnifle shook his
      head sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quiet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;See that road. Nothing stirring. What is there for
      the missus to look at when she sits in the window?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s morning,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Things will be brisker in the afternoon.&rdquo; But
      his tone lacked conviction, and he could not resist the temptation to add:
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a cat crossing the road now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out,&rdquo; said Minnifle. &ldquo;This&rsquo;ull none do,&rdquo; and when they stood upon
      the door-step he sniffed the air of Whalley Range with disapproval. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t like it and it&rsquo;s no use pretending that I do. It&rsquo;s got a cold smell
      to me. It isn&rsquo;t homely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you mean,&rdquo; said Sam, diagnosing the trouble. &ldquo;Wait a bit.&rdquo; He
      gave the cabman an address and was careful to leave the window open. They
      came to other streets where the scent of yesterday&rsquo;s fried fish still
      lingered in the air and the nose of Mr. Minnifle inhaled it greedily.
      &ldquo;This is better,&rdquo; he pronounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had come to Greenheys, which, when De Quincey&rsquo;s father built a
      country house there in 1791, was &ldquo;separated from the last outskirts of
      Manchester by an entire mile.&rdquo; It is by no means separated now, and good
      houses of the mid-Victorian period are to be had cheaply because good
      tenants dislike bad neighbours. Travers had one of these survivals from an
      urbane past on his books and Sam hugged himself for thinking of it now:
      that house had proved itself the whitest of white elephants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Minnifie, exhilarated by the spicy smells of Greenheys, was no longer
      a timid excursionist looking only where his guide bade him, but a house
      hunter hot upon the trail, with eyes that spied on each side of their
      route.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he called suddenly. &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cabman stopped. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re not there,&rdquo; said Sam, rather blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we are,&rdquo; said Minnifie, and got out of the cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam followed, in that leaden state of mind which often precedes
      inspiration. What had attracted Minnifie was a semi-detached house at a
      corner, which the trams passed. Opposite were shops, and there was a
      lively stir in the street. Certainly, Mrs. Minnifie would have something
      to see here when she looked out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam knew that pair of houses, and what he knew made him fear that he would
      not, this time, rid Mr. Travers of the white elephant on his books. They
      were good houses enough, but the people who had furniture to fill them
      were not the sort of people who welcomed shops opposite their windows and
      trams past their gate, so that both had been long empty. Now, however,
      they were for sale, under a will, and a quick sale was wanted that the
      estate might be wound up. They would certainly go cheaply on that account,
      and the more so since two attempted auctions had proved abortive. There
      had been no offers.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here was Mr. Minnilie plainly delighted, and those houses not in
      Travers&rsquo; charge, but in that of a rival agency! Sam felt depressed, then
      as dawn follows darkness, lie thought of what Travers had said, that Sam&rsquo;s
      word was as good as his own. It was going to be, and Mr. Minnifie&rsquo;s money
      as good in Sam&rsquo;s hands as in those of Calverts&rsquo;, the legitimate agents for
      this pair of houses. He stepped out briskly now, the ardent salesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, Mr. Minnifie. I haven&rsquo;t the key of this house with me, but it
      is at the shop opposite. I will get it.&rdquo; His quick eye had read so much on
      Calverts&rsquo; notice board, but by the time he returned, Minnifie had also
      seen that rival name on the board and mentioned the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;The board has not been altered, but this property is
      in my hands now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Which was true.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house enchanted Minnifie, who had made up his mind in advance to be
      enchanted. And, of course, rooms may be in need of decoration, but good
      proportions tell, even on a Mr. Minnifie. This house was very different
      from the jerry-built villas of Whalley Range.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s price?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three hundred and fifteen pounds,&rdquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said three hundred and I&rsquo;ll none budge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will come to the office at six, I shall be able to tell you,&rdquo; said
      Sam, naming a queer hour, seeing that the office closed at half-past five.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Minnifie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a firm offer at three hundred, and I&rsquo;m a
      man of my word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam devoutly hoped so. He was taking a considerable gamble on it. They
      parted, and Sam, as usual, went home for lunch, but, not as usual,
      returned with his cheque-book in his pocket. His accumulated savings were
      five pounds, but he possessed a cheque-book. He waited rather carefully
      until the banks had closed, then he walked into Calverts&rsquo; offices and
      offered them two hundred and fifty pounds for the pair of semi-detached
      houses in Greenheys. They accepted two hundred and seventy-five; and Sam
      drew a cheque for that amount, and received the title-deeds in exchange.
      Then he palpitated, but it was, in any case, safely after banking hours.
      Calverts could not present his cheque that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was busy at five-thirty, when the clerks left, and proposed to work
      late for a while, &ldquo;to clear things up,&rdquo; he said. At six Minnifie arrived,
      true to his word, and Sam could have kissed him. He had spent the longest
      half hour of his life. He took Minnifie by the private door into Travers&rsquo; 
      office, so that he should not see the empty general office, and put him in
      the client&rsquo;s chair, himself usurping Travers&rsquo; seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Minnifie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;suppose I told you that the price is still
      three fifteen, what would you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say &lsquo;Good-day,&rsquo;&rdquo; and Minnifie showed that he meant it by rising to
      his feet. Sam went on hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Then it&rsquo;s as well that I&rsquo;ve succeeded. It has been an infinitude of
      trouble&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon,&rdquo; said Minnifie, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;re here to take trouble. Leastways,
      if it&rsquo;s easy money in your line, it&rsquo;s the only line that&rsquo;s made that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we have our troubles, like everybody else. This document,&rdquo; he went
      on, &ldquo;conveys the house to you. The price is three hundred pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bargain,&rdquo; said Mr. Minnifie, producing his notes, &ldquo;count&rsquo;em.&rdquo; Sam
      counted feverishly, then made out a receipt. Nothing short of murder would
      have induced him to part with that money now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will meet me to-morrow at twelve at that address&mdash;a lawyer&rsquo;s&mdash;we
      will have the conveyance put in proper form.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a bit of lawyers lately over this brass of mine,&rdquo; said
      Minnifie, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t like&rsquo;em. They eat money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in this case,&rdquo; said Sam magnanimously, &ldquo;I pay the lawyer&rsquo;s fees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll be there,&rdquo; said Minnifie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam was waiting next day for the doors of his bank to open, and breathed
      colossal relief when his three hundred pounds were safely in to meet his
      cheque. He had a net profit of some twenty pounds, after settling for the
      conveyancing, and he had a house to sell. Not long afterwards, he sold it
      for one hundred and seventy-five pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that one of the pair had been thought desirable by somebody
      caused somebody else to desire the other: and Sam could only hope that the
      new neighbours would not compare notes. If they did, it did not matter; he
      had only obeyed the axiom of commerce, &ldquo;Buy cheap, sell dear,&rdquo; and it was
      not his fault that in the one case he had had to sell less dearly than in
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      His bank credit was two hundred pounds.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N Sam&rsquo;s opinion,
      nobody had suffered. Mr. Travers lost nothing, because the corner house
      had conquered Minnifie at sight, and he would not in any case have bought
      the white elephant which Travers had for sale. Calverts had got as much as
      they expected to get for the houses, or they would not have sold, while
      the beneficiary under the late owner&rsquo;s will was a charity, and Sam hoped
      that charity was charitable enough not to look a gift-horse in the mouth:
      if it wasn&rsquo;t, it ought to be. As to the purchasers, who had certainly paid
      more for the property than they need have done, that was what purchasers
      were for. Why did smart business men exist if not to exploit purchasers?
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was highly comforting, but to confess the need for comfort was to
      admit to disquiet, and he found that it was one thing to argue in this
      strain with his conscience, and another to boast to Anne of his
      achievement. Women don&rsquo;t understand business, and he had an uneasy feeling
      that the ethics of the transaction would not satisfy Anne. He decided that
      he had better not tell her, that he must resist his impulse of surprising
      her with the gift of a seal-skin coat, and remained a capitalist under the
      rose. There was no hurry, and perhaps his next stroke, when it came, would
      be under conditions that would bear the limelight of her scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      But repression was not all. Justify himself as he would, chuckle over his
      gains as he did, the matter searched him deeply and reacted sharply in two
      ways, of which the first began as that old expedient of sinners,
      conscience-money. There are defaulters who find absolution for themselves
      by sending notes, under initials, to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and
      by having them acknowledged with impressiveness in the personal columns of
      the <i>Times</i>. That was not Sam&rsquo;s way: he did not do good deeds by
      stealth, and his conscience-money did not go out of the family. He used it
      philanthropically, but it was philanthropy and ten per cent, to begin
      with, and in the end it was very much more than ten per cent. It was the
      Chappie Bill Posting and Window-Cleaning Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought that he could, without exciting Anne&rsquo;s suspicions, tell her
      that his savings had reached ten pounds, and proposed to spend that sum
      for the benefit of George Chappie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspired, perhaps, by his household gods, George was facing life bravely,
      and won a minor place in Anne&rsquo;s good graces when he and Madge produced a
      firstborn son, who had the remarkable quality of looking exactly like the
      infant Samuel, whose name he bore. But George had not, in her opinion,
      deserved Sam&rsquo;s generosity to this extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re over-good to them,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made a man and woman of a
      pair of wastrels, and I&rsquo;d let them alone to make their own way now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it will be much of a way?&rdquo; asked Sam. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re the sort that
      need help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll lean on you all right. They&rsquo;re good at leaning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sam, drawing himself up. &ldquo;Let them lean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not fond, but if I told you what I think of you for
      this, you&rsquo;d have the right to call me fond and foolish. I like you very
      well, my son. You&rsquo;re the strong man helping and supporting the weak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She finished suddenly and a thought shamefacedly. She had praised him
      openly and considered it a weakness in her. Sam put a hand on her
      shoulder. It was not demonstrative, but his gesture was full of
      understanding, and Anne turned rapidly away, shaking him off almost with
      rudeness, taking very earnestly to her business of clearing away their
      tea-things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam watched appreciatively through the corner of his eye. He relished
      praise from Anne, even when, as now, it was not strictly merited. The
      strong in Sam&rsquo;s philosophy did not support the weak, but the weak the
      strong. He was confirmed in his belief that women could not understand
      business. This, however, he reminded himself, was not pure business, it
      was conscience-money, which ought not to be unconscionably reproductive:
      so he bought George a hand-cart, ladder, bucket and leathers, and exacted
      from him not more than ten per cent, on his capital expenditure. In
      Travers&rsquo; business Sam found opportunities of pushing George. A client took
      a house, and Sam would suggest with a nicely casual air that the windows
      needed cleaning. He would, to save the client trouble, then offer to send
      a man round, so that George&rsquo;s connection waxed, and he prospered to the
      tune of two amazing pounds a week, till the restless Sam began to widen
      his view of George&rsquo;s potentialities.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eye for the main chance had always a useful squint which could see
      money round the corner as well as in the straight high road, and he
      thought that George, with his outfit of ladders, could see his talent for
      height in other ways than window cleaning. There was, for example,
      bill-posting, a trade whose mysteries Sam deemed it not beyond George&rsquo;s
      capabilities to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing grew by degrees, from the first builder&rsquo;s hoarding which Sam
      rented venturously for advertising space, to a comfortable little business
      that ran itself by its own momentum long after he tired of its comparative
      insignificance. With George, the start was all: he could always plod where
      Sam had led, and as Sam had time to set the ball rolling, and money enough
      to spoon-feed the infant business with capital, George kept the thing in
      being by careful, steady management. He hadn&rsquo;t boasted when he told Anne
      he was steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, Sam was impatient and deplored his active partner&rsquo;s inactivity.
      He grew tired of the gradual increase, but, all the same, the business was
      unquestionably successful, and he relished hugely his sense of being the
      power behind the throne, if only behind a small, conservative, so
      lamentably unambitious throne. Sam also was among the king makers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other, greater sequel to his reaction led to more pyrotechnical
      results, and eventually to Sam&rsquo;s launch on his career. Nothing happened at
      first, and indeed for so long that he was feeling himself between the
      devil of the estate office and the deep sea of George&rsquo;s persistent
      carefulness. The Chappie Bill-Posting Company was good enough for George,
      but not for Sam: there were too many com petitors with too great
      resources, while the estate office routine bored him, and opportunities
      for piratical enterprise did not recur.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt, at twenty-four years of age, and at two pounds ten a week, that
      he was growing old in service, he who was not meant to serve but to be
      served.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then&mdash;desolating thought&mdash;was he meant to be served? Had he
      lost, or was he, at any rate, not losing the accent of speech and mind of
      those who are served? He knew that his accent had touched pitch and been
      defiled: those bawdy stories of his were told in the tongue of his
      hearers, and there had been clients lately who had spoken to him, when
      inspecting property, as if he were a clerk, and not a pleasant,
      gentlemanly youth of obvious superiority to his present, no doubt
      temporary, job. He had a sudden fear that the job might not be temporary
      after all, and there followed a time when he was wholly bent on
      self-improvement, when he abjured the narrow way of professional
      text-books and read that he might become well-read, that he might bandy
      allusions with those old school-fellows of his who had gone to
      Universities, that he might, if he could not hope to shine, at least be
      not outshone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn&rsquo;t <i>pour le bon motif</i>, and he did not even pretend to like
      the greater part of what he read. He crammed against the grain, and a
      growing row of the &ldquo;World&rsquo;s Classics&rdquo; figured on his shelf as trophies of
      his perseverance. Industriously he rubbed away the rust which had
      accumulated on his mind since it took its not very brilliant polish of the
      Grammar School. He took down the dust-stained Gibbon he had won for
      reading, and ploughed heroically through it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That reminded him of another chink in his armour. A man of the world must
      have the knack of speaking to the world, and Sam became a member of the
      Concentrics. As Anne once told him, he had the gift of the gab, but,
      except for his present fluent recommendations of houses to prospective
      tenants, it was a talent he had buried. Now, however, he proposed to dig
      it up and did it in (he thought) the ambitious surroundings of the
      Concentrics, who were indeed as mixed a company as he could have found
      anywhere, and on that account the better for his purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The common centre which was supposed to hold the Concentrics together was
      a love of literature, but they tended to drop literature for politics on
      the slightest pretext. There were literary enthusiasts amongst them, but
      it rarely happened that one man&rsquo;s enthusiasm coincided with another&rsquo;s. It
      did less than coincide. A member would read a laborious paper on some man
      of letters, and the subsequent discussion would be conducted by men who
      began their intelligent speeches by admitting that they had not read a
      word of, say, Henry James or Lafcadio Hearn, but that their opinion was
      nevertheless so and so. Whereas, of course, nobody ever confessed to
      ignorance of politics. Politics is like law, only more so. One is presumed
      by the law to know the law, which is highly presumptuous of the law,
      because not even the lawyers know the law, and they must often go to
      judges, at their client&rsquo;s expense, to find out what the law is: and the
      &ldquo;more so,&rdquo; as applied to politics, is that while laymen hesitate to argue
      a point of law, and go to an expert, they never hesitate to argue a point
      of politics, and <i>are</i> the expert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Political discussions amongst the Concentrics were real and passionate,
      literary discussions unreal and frigid; and as &ldquo;social reform&rdquo; became a
      favourite shibboleth about this time, literature took a back seat in
      favour of subjects about which men could grow emotional and their oratory
      rhetorical. It was all one to Sam, who was here to speak, and did his
      reading at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke often, so that he soon improved, and he practised the literary
      allusiveness which was the purpose of his reading to such effect that he
      attracted the attention of the chairman, who was the Rev. Peter Struggles.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not, strictly, fair to say that a man is handicapped through life by
      a name like Struggles, because the legal process by which one can change
      an undesirable name is inexpensive, but Peter had never thought of such a
      move, and wore his handicap without being aware of it. In any case, he
      failed in life. He had a round face, red hair, side-whiskers: took snuff
      and messed his coat: was perfectly futile in practical affairs and
      absolutely &ldquo;a dear.&rdquo; His scholarship was not profound, but he loved
      letters genuinely, He had failed steadily for thirty years to run a
      private school for boys in a suburb which was degenerating to
      industrialism, and late in life had taken orders, quite sincerely, not in
      the least with the idea of helping his school with a new respectability.
      It was, anyhow, beyond help, and a man who offered tradesmen&rsquo;s sons a
      sound commercial education was presently to buy him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Struggles, well in his fifties, became curate to a vicar of forty,
      in the large, rough-and-tumble parish of St. Mary&rsquo;s. One says that he had
      failed in life, and, by Sam&rsquo;s standards, he had, and even by the working
      standards of his church. A man at fifty-six should not be a curate with an
      income of some hundred and twenty pounds a year. But if a man is happy at
      fifty-six to be a curate with that income? If he find satisfaction in it?
      Snuff was his indulgence, and the chairmanship of the Concentrics, who
      were not sectarian, his dissipation. For the rest, Peter had made harbour.
      To the pushing educationist who had bought him out, for a song, and now
      profaned his old school buildings with shorthand and the rudiments of
      bookkeeping, Peter was a failure and a pathetic failure. He was not
      conscious of failure himself, nor of anything but a serene contentment
      that he had found, if late, the work that he was fit to do. Through sheer
      single-minded, inoffensive, unobtrusive goodness he came to be a figure in
      that parish, and a power. Undignified in bearing, and careless in dress,
      he had a dignity of mind and soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam Branstone despised a worldly failure, here was a man of more than
      twice Sam&rsquo;s years, with less money than Sam had, and, by all his canons,
      Sam should have despised Peter. But he didn&rsquo;t. It was partly, no doubt,
      other people&rsquo;s opinions that influenced Sam&mdash;the universal esteem
      which Peter Struggles won&mdash;but it was by much more the innate
      nobility of the old curate. Sam began his speaking at the Concentrics to
      impress his fellow members, he ended by caring only for the appreciation
      of the quaint, slovenly figure who occupied the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got the appreciation he craved. Peter was shrewd enough to discount
      Sam&rsquo;s rhetorics, and the flashy tricks of apt quotation: he saw Sam as a
      misguided, self-seeking thruster who read only for veneer and spoke only
      to impress. But, at least, Sam tried, and Peter could admire perseverance.
      The thing was to direct Sam&rsquo;s perseverance well, and Peter asked him to
      supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our man of the world was prodigiously thrilled. The honour was
      exceptional, for Peter could not afford to be a host often, and Sam was
      aware not only of its rarity, but of Peter&rsquo;s unique standing in the
      parish: and, more than that, of Peter&rsquo;s worth. To be singled out by Peter
      Struggles, and asked to sup, was, socially, a triumph. It sounds absurd,
      and perhaps it is absurd that one good man should shine so brightly by
      contrast with the fifteen thousand others of an over-crowded parish, but
      that was why Peter was a colossus amongst the pigmies, and why Sam
      Branstone was egregiously excited by an invitation to sup at Peter&rsquo;s
      little house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter did not invite Sam to preach at him. It was the boy&rsquo;s mind rather
      than his soul that was the target of his aim, and Peter&rsquo;s select library
      to which he trusted for influence. Certainly the little meal of cold beef
      and cocoa was not calculated to impress, nor the old, worn furniture, with
      the gaping rents in its horse-hair coverings, through which the stuffing
      poured. He handled books with reverence, and spoke of them, but Sam was
      hardly listening. He was under fire from another battery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ada Struggles met young men at church functions, and spoke with them at
      Sunday School, but she had few opportunities of greater intimacy, and was
      not the lady to waste so rare a chance as this. Peter droned on amongst
      his books and presently was lost in reading one. Ada lost herself in
      nothing except a burning desire, to monopolize Sam. Books did not interest
      Ada: getting married did.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trouble was that in the days of his school&rsquo;s comparative prosperity,
      Peter had done Ada rather well. Perhaps as a schoolmaster himself, he got
      special consideration over terms, but at any rate he had sent her to a
      good boarding school. She had received the education of a lady, and it
      wasn&rsquo;t fair, it didn&rsquo;t chime with the fitness of things that she should
      now be the daughter of an impractical curate. Her case, to some extent,
      was parallel with Sam&rsquo;s: the past of both had augured well, and the future
      depended on their wits.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, however, the parallel ceased, for Ada had few wits, but she had
      moods, and the reverse side of the moping discontent, which was endemic
      with her, was the meretricious brilliance she now paraded for Sam&rsquo;s
      entanglement. Ada was &ldquo;all out&rdquo; after her prey, in her best clothes and
      her best, that is, her most captivatingly genial manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam thought that she illuminated that dingy book-surrounded room. They
      were not gay books with gilded bindings, but solid, well-worn volumes of
      ponderous aspect. The books repelled and Ada invited. Youth called to
      youth: youth answered to the call.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was obsessed with his idea of accent, and the worldly value of
      superiority in speech. Ada&rsquo;s first appeal to him, though she did not know
      it, was that she spoke well; her second was that she was her father&rsquo;s
      daughter; her third, as she knew perfectly, was the helplessness which she
      used cunningly to flatter his masculine importance. She told him without a
      word that he was a strong, powerful man, and she a flower which he might
      pluck and wear. And she did the anemone business quite effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not much of Ada, and what there was was not remarkable, but she
      was fluffy and frilly and feminine in the feebler way. She had on
      something that was not silk but suggested the rustle of silk. After all,
      it was not Ada&rsquo;s fault that it was not silk, or that her intimate
      underclothing was of flannelette; she could only use the opportunities she
      had, and they were few.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had the prettiness, the rather silly and never lasting prettiness,
      which accompanies anæmia.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would not wear, and she knew that it would not wear. She was becoming
      desperate. Sam was sent by heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought so, too. Old Struggles read &ldquo;Marcus Aurelius,&rdquo; standing by his
      book-shelf, utterly forgetful of his guest, and the guest thought that
      Peter&rsquo;s preoccupation was also instructed by heaven. It left him free for
      Ada.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he said to Ada and what Ada said to him were things of no importance:
      their serious conversation was not conducted by their tongues, but by
      their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the sort of thing:
    </p>
    <p>
      Ada (her voice): Of course, I remember seeing you quite often in church,
      Mr. Branstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Her eyes): And you found favour in my sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam (his voice): Naturally, I always saw you whenever I went.
    </p>
    <p>
      (His eyes): It was for you I went to church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ada (her voice): I&rsquo;m glad that you were able to come in to-night. I am
      often lonely in the evenings. Father is so wrapped up in his books.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Her eyes): Meeting you is the great moment of my life. I&rsquo;m an unhappy
      princess in an ogre&rsquo;s tower. Rescue me. Rescue me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam ( his voice): It was most kind of Mr. Struggles to ask me in for a
      talk about books.
    </p>
    <p>
      (His eyes): Books be damned. I&rsquo;m fascinated by the sensuous rustle of your
      skirts, and I&rsquo;m a hero sent to kiss the wistful look away from your
      pleading eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so on. By the end of the evening, had the unsaid speeches or half of
      them been written down, Ada had evidence enough to have brought a breach
      of promise action against a recalcitrant Sam. Only Sam was not
      recalcitrant, but, on the contrary, ardent. It was, Ada congratulated
      herself, uncommonly good going for a first meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter emerged from &ldquo;Marcus Aurelius&rdquo; with a gentle smile which lighted up
      his undistinguished face. &ldquo;Yes. Pagan but grand,&rdquo; he said, quite unaware
      that half an hour had passed since he last spoke. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lend you this
      book, Branstone, and now&rdquo;.&mdash;he glanced at the clock&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
      that I must turn you out. I&rsquo;d no idea it was so late. How rapidly the time
      passes when one is talking about one&rsquo;s books!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII&mdash;ADA STRUGGLES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HERE were moments
      during that night when Sam imagined that he was in the stranglehold of a
      grand passion: times when he quite successfully deceived himself that he
      burned for Ada.
    </p>
    <p>
      And certainly the experience, unique for him, of a sleepless night lent
      colour to the belief that he was passionately in love, whereas he was, in
      fact, merely attracted by a girl who had spared no pains to attract; and
      what kept Sam awake was not passion but calculation. The affair, indeed,
      was as broad as it was long: it had a slender basis of mutual attraction,
      and a monstrous superstructure on each side of self-interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not &ldquo;see through&rdquo; Ada to the point of being prophetic about her,
      but he did even from the beginning perceive that Anne was not likely to be
      enthusiastic. But would Anne greet any daughter-in-law with open arms? Was
      there born the daughter of Eve whom Anne would think the peer of her Sam?
      He did not want to cross his mother, but a man must be a man, and a
      mother&rsquo;s fondness and her jealousy of the intending wife were things about
      which one had to be callous. The world, as Benedick said, must be peopled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne would see eye to eye with him as to the practical advantages of Ada.
      Ada was Peter&rsquo;s daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      That parentage had, by way of discount, the defect of its quality.
      Socially it was a great thing to be Peter&rsquo;s son-in-law, and not only
      socially but ideally. Sam&rsquo;s admiration for the curate was genuine enough,
      and he knew that Anne shared it. But there was the question of money, and
      Peter had none. Sam kept his mother, and would have to keep his wife. He
      saw in Ada an asset which he could ultimately exploit, but, in the
      meantime, until there came into his mind the scheme which should turn his
      association with Peter into money, he must reckon on a tight period. Anne
      would see the tight period, but not the unborn, fruitful plan on which he
      counted for their future. And he could not hurry that plan to birth. His
      schemes came to him when he least expected them, spontaneously. They were
      not to be forced by worry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, he reminded himself, there was no hurry. He had only just met Ada,
      and was planning as if his engagement ring were on her finger. Not that he
      had any serious doubts about that ring and Ada&rsquo;s willingness to wear it,
      but she did not wear it yet, and there was time in hand, and to spare, for
      consideration of these practical affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, he loved her, and love, according to the authors, was the most
      wonderful thing in the world. He told himself very firmly that he loved
      Ada, and that love was wonderful. Reiteration is so potent that before
      morning he believed what he wished to believe. He recalled the soft
      pressure of her hand when she said &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; the froufrou of her
      skirt, her melting eye; and persuaded himself that Ada Struggles was a
      pearl beyond price.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was perfectly sure that he loved her, and for proof there was his
      sleeplessness. It occurred to him that as he could not sleep, and was only
      thinking in circles, he might as well do something to hasten the time when
      he could see Ada again. He could not return &ldquo;Marcus Aurelius&rdquo; to Peter
      until he had read it, and if he returned it with unexpected promptitude,
      he must be ready to face a stiff examination in it; therefore he lit the
      gas and read &ldquo;Marcus Aurelius&rdquo; by way of serving Ada, whom he loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hard service, too, for there was not much in Sam&rsquo;s philosophy which agreed
      with the Emperor&rsquo;s, but two nights later he was ringing Peter&rsquo;s bell with
      the book under his arm, an ordered précis of it in his mind, and some
      selected passages from it on his tongue. They were not selected because
      Sam liked them, but because he thought Peter liked them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter was out, but Ada was in, and, curiously enough for one who was not
      an optimist either by nature or experience, dressed again in her Sunday
      clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened the door to him. &ldquo;Father is out, Mr. Branstone,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only called to return him this book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think he will be long,&rdquo; said Ada promptly, who knew very well
      that Peter would certainly be late. &ldquo;Will you not come in and wait for
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came, crossing his Rubicon. The unchaperoned intimacy of that night
      struck both of them as a daring short cut to a position to which they were
      not entitled&mdash;a thing properly done only by the engaged and the
      maturely and securely engaged. Luck fought for Ada.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t stay very long,&rdquo; he hedged desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ada sat down and crossed her knees. A neat ankle was effectively on
      exhibition. &ldquo;That chair of father&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is fairly comfortable.&rdquo;
       Also, it faced Ada&rsquo;s, and he drew up another, less inviting, chair, and
      placed it flush with the fire. Except by a side-glance, he could not see
      her ankle now, and evaded that aphrodisiac, while Peter&rsquo;s chair, though
      empty, completed the semi-circle, and seemed to give a sort of countenance
      to their interview. Sam drew much comfort from that chair, and tried to
      guide their conversation into literary paths of which the chair would have
      approved. He discoursed of &ldquo;Marcus Aurelius,&rdquo; and he was very dull, but
      felt virtuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ada did not believe that it was virtuous to be dull, and mentally cursed
      that <i>tertium quid</i>, the ghost of Peter Struggles, whom Sam had so
      firmly established in his chair; but she saw that the pace was not to be
      quickened here, under Peter&rsquo;s roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think your knowledge of books is wonderful, Mr. Branstone,&rdquo; she said,
      when Sam had exhausted his ideas about &ldquo;Marcus Aurelius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never find time to read, myself. Whenever I have the opportunity of
      recreation, I go out for exercise.&rdquo; The statement lacked the merit of
      truth She never took exercise, but was adept at sitting in front of a fire
      doing exactly nothing. The point was that in this house of the good Peter,
      Sam&rsquo;s enterprise was burked, and she wanted him where he could race
      without a handicap. &ldquo;Do you ever go to Heaton Park?&rdquo; she asked
      conversationally. &ldquo;I shall probably be going there on Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With&mdash;with your father?&rdquo; asked Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she answered brightly. &ldquo;Saturday is sermon day. That is why I am
      in the way here, although,&rdquo; she added pathetically, &ldquo;I fear he often finds
      me in the way. I am not bookish like you and him.&rdquo; She gave that
      explanation suddenly, and it satisfied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not really bookish, either,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Of course you won&rsquo;t be going
      alone to Heaton Park.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hoped not. &ldquo;I expect so,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam took the plunge. &ldquo;Could I have the honour of accompanying you, Miss
      Struggles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you are so busy. I must not waste your time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be wasted with you,&rdquo; said Sam, and glanced guiltily at
      Peter&rsquo;s chair, as if he had exceeded the limits of propriety, but he had
      never seen Peter with anything but a benevolent smile, on his face, and
      was unable to see him imaginatively now in any other mood. He took fresh
      courage. &ldquo;May I call for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Ada, &ldquo;would never do. It would disturb father at his sermon.
      I shall go by tram at about three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; She rose. There was nothing to
      be done with Sam in that house, but she pinned her faith to Heaton Park:
      and not in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allow for the difference in size, distance and the general scale of
      things, and Heaton Park may be regarded as the Manchester equivalent to
      Richmond Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once upon a time the Manchester Town Council had a magnificent
      opportunity, and lost it. There are legends that they did not mean to lose
      it, and that they did not lose it through any fault of theirs. But they
      lost it. They lost the chance of buying Trafford Park, which lies along
      the banks of the Manchester Ship Canal, and was bought by Mr. Ernest Terah
      Hooley. It is said that Trafford Park, now a flourishing and rather
      American-look-ing industrial town (even the streets in its residential
      area are numbered, and not named, after the American plan, and railways
      stray about the roads, <i>more Americano</i>), is the one successful
      enterprise associated with the name of Hooley. That may or may not be
      true: at any rate the Manchester Town Council missed its chance at
      Trafford Park, and when Heaton Park, another old estate, came into the
      market, the Council did not repeat their mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      One goes, ascending all the way, through Cheetham Hill, the Ghetto, to the
      heights of Crumpsall and the Park by a municipal tram, which is admirably
      cheap or criminally cheap (according to one&rsquo;s views on municipal trams),
      and, in any case, magnificently efficient: and at the end of the ride, one
      finds beauty. One may find tea at Heaton Hall, and pictures that overflow
      from the meagre Art Gallery in Mosley Street, and municipal golf-links,
      but one finds also beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a rolling country, raised above the smoke, dotted with wood and
      lake. Old gardens cling about the Hall, with rhododendron glades where
      there are sculpture and pools, and the Park rolls free in open air that is
      as clean as any air can be within five miles of Manchester Town Hall. It,
      lacks of Paradise, and if one can see green hills from Heaton Park, one
      cannot kelp but see the factory stacks that crown them or rise up from the
      valleys, but beauty lingers here on the outskirts of an ugly city secure
      against the jerry-builder and the ultimate defilement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ada was going to Heaton Park. Lovers have gone to Heaton Park before Ada
      and they will go when Ada has crumbled to dust. Ada went, and Sam went
      with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went with her, not she with him: but if she led, he was very, very far
      from admitting it, though it may have been his obscure, subconscious
      knowledge of her leadership which made him outwardly assume the mien and
      the gestures of a leader. He asserted, every inch of him, that he was man,
      the conqueror, and she permitted the assertion and flattered it. Leading,
      indeed, was not a habit of Ada&rsquo;s, who was born to be led, but it is given
      to all of us to outstrip our nature on occasion, and this was Ada&rsquo;s
      chance. A subtle skill was granted her that she might be cunning with her
      opportunity. She was all calculation now, while Sam forgot to calculate,
      and walked with Ada on his arm along the main drive of Heaton Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Romance kept step with him and put a radiant veil between his sober senses
      and this witching hour: through glamour he beheld his Ada, and saw that
      she was good. He soared to high ambition, either to die or to possess the
      nymph, and now, that heady hour, to put all to the test amongst the
      rhododendron bushes behind the Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, by a patch of ancient turf, he halted her, and found a seat near
      the pool where water-lilies thrive: a lovers&rsquo; nook, love haunted. Who
      knows what ardours of the old régime, when lords and ladies trod that
      turf, had passed upon the now decaying stone of that comely seat? What
      ghostly lovers in satin and brocade stood round to bless them or to mock?
      Wood pigeons cooed above them, calling the tune, and Sam danced to it in
      an ecstasy of hot desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had the sleek self-satisfaction of a cat, the same unhurried certainty
      that the mouse was hers to gobble when she chose. Ada was very happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But apprehension gripped him now. He had not known her for a week, and she
      was Ada. Peter&rsquo;s daughter. He stood aghast at his precipitance, then, with
      the feeling that it was after all a &ldquo;stroke&rdquo; (though a larger one than
      ever before), and that he believed in acting promptly, cleared his throat
      and plunged into speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Struggles,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I know that I have only made your acquaintance
      during the current week, but I seem to have known you all my life. It&rsquo;s
      because I used to see you in church, I daresay. I mean we were not
      strangers when we met, and, anyhow,&rdquo; he continued recklessly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      care if we were. I&rsquo;m not the hesitating sort. I mean, show me a thing, and
      I can tell you right off whether it&rsquo;s good or bad. My mind&rsquo;s made up in a
      jiffy: that&rsquo;s the kind of fellow I am. And when my mind&rsquo;s made up, I act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ada had given a little gasp at the phrasing of his opening&mdash;that
      &ldquo;during the current week,&rdquo; an idiom from his business correspondence
      slipping in here to mark his nervousness&mdash;but he was fairly launched
      now, and she purred gently like a cat well lubricated with butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Branstone,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I think men ought to be resolute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;And so I am. Quite resolute and quite determined
      about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About me?&rdquo; She turned innocent eyes wonderingly at him. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know
      you were being personal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am. I am,&rdquo; he repeated, and took her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Branstone,&rdquo; she murmured, as one who sees a vision splendid in a
      dream, and let her hand lie limp in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent to her. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; he asked hoarsely, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you call me Sam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She called him Sam, and he kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ada!&rdquo; He spoke her name like a caress. &ldquo;Ada!&rdquo; Her name was wonderful; she
      was a miracle; Sam was triumphant love. At that moment he was passionately
      in love, and he had conquered. He had pressed the lips of his divinity,
      shyly, with a revealing inexpertness which should have charmed her, who,
      being a woman, knew all about love while Sam was in short trousers. It
      didn&rsquo;t charm Ada, it touched no deeper chord than satisfaction at a good
      job well done. This was his first, his freshest love, but she cared only
      that the fish was on her line, securely hooked. He saw her face, idealized
      her face and gloried in her face: she saw a wedding-ring, she was to be
      Mrs., she was to escape the book-ridden home of Peter Struggles. Both had
      their moment then, but Sam, in his, loved Ada, and Ada only loved herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling,&rdquo; he said, and sought her lips again She saw the thirst of him&mdash;and
      used it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew back. &ldquo;I do not think you ought to kiss me again until we have
      mentioned this to father,&rdquo; said Ada Struggles, digging the hook more
      deeply in her fish. &ldquo;Not,&rdquo; she went on, as she saw him flinch, &ldquo;that I do
      not want you to. Only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, as she left it at the &ldquo;only,&rdquo; and allowed him to
      appreciate her infinite delicacy. &ldquo;Yes. Of course. Shall we have tea at
      the Hall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Ada, &ldquo;ought we to?&rdquo; She was seen to tremble on the brink of a
      delicious temptation, and with difficulty to resist. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; she
      decided, &ldquo;not yet. But father will have finished his sermon by now, and if
      you came and saw him at once, then... then, Sam...&rdquo; She eyed him,
      languishing, and opened up for him the golden vista of a jocund courtship&mdash;once
      Peter had been &ldquo;seen.&rdquo; He came, obediently, to see Peter, and she relaxed
      her standard so far as to take his arm down the drive of Heaton Park.
      Indeed, just at the corner by the copse, where they were hidden, he had an
      arm round her waist: his feet trod air, and his head was with the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ada was thinking, &ldquo;If he gets the engagement ring to-night, I can show it
      after church to-morrow.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX&mdash;ADA AND A MAD TRAM-CAR
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N general grounds&mdash;on
      the grounds, for instance, of anything so out-of-date and out of reason as
      filial piety&mdash;Ada was quite indifferent to Peter&rsquo;s &ldquo;consent,&rdquo; and
      wanted it only to shackle Sam more firmly. She had not much doubt that
      Peter would consent, as in fact he did, though not so readily as she had
      anticipated. She did not exhibit an engagement ring at church next day for
      the reason that she had none to exhibit. Peter kept Sam too late for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Ada was wrong about Peter: she thought him a good man and
      consequently a perfect fool, whereas his foolishness was imperfect, and he
      was subject, like most unworldly people, to streaks of acumen about
      worldly affairs. They come sometimes, these disconcerting fits of
      perception, as if a dam had burst, and usually the times are inconvenient
      to those who have reckoned on the unworldliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter answered her expectation so far as to say, &ldquo;Bless my soul,&rdquo; and so
      far only. After that, he began an elaborate and skilful catechism of Sam,
      which pretended to be a friendly talk about books, but was really an
      examination of Sam Branstone, his character and disposition. At the
      beginning Peter knew little of Sam beyond what his observations at the
      Concentrics had told him, and Sam&rsquo;s volunteered remarks about his salary
      and his prospects interested Peter to a very slight extent. At the end
      Peter decided that Sam was to be trusted to make things easy for Ada on
      the material side, and that spiritually he was not beyond hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had not, spiritually, been touched as yet. Would Ada touch him?
      That was the question for Peter, who knew his Ada. Ada could be led. He
      admitted that he himself had failed with her, but he was not a strong man.
      A strong man, with love as his ally, could lead Ada, could form her, and
      Sam had strength, and, Peter thought, love. It depended, then, on whether
      Sam&rsquo;s love for Ada, reacting on him, would quicken his latent spirituality
      so that the lead he gave to Ada would be good. And on the whole Peter
      thought there was a reasonable chance. He believed in the power of love,
      he believed that love is God and God is love, and confronted with his pair
      of self-confessed lovers he read their future optimistically in the light
      of his belief. What else could Peter do? They said they were in love, they
      appeared to be in love, they had the symptoms of the state of love. He
      could only judge the case on the evidence before the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not know that with Sam the symptoms, though real, were temporary,
      and with Ada an intelligent mimicry. He gave his assent to their
      engagement formally and very solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam left the house late, thrilling with Ada&rsquo;s &ldquo;Good-night&rdquo; kiss, but the
      glow was quick to fade, and he found himself thinking rather of Peter than
      of Ada, whom of course, he loved. If ever probe was gentle, it was
      Peter&rsquo;s: nevertheless, Sam had felt the probe antagonistically. He had
      shivered naked before Peter&rsquo;s inquisition, he had understood that he was
      under examination, and resented it. It was, however disguisedly,
      opposition, and the thought of that kindly opponent led him to think of
      one from whom, also, opposition was to be expected, and, probably, less
      tactfully. It led to Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, that was the fate of lovers: it was the way to deepen love and,
      perhaps already a little doubtful of his love, he welcomed the idea of
      Anne in opposition. It was curious that, while he thought of Ada as the
      one woman in the world, he should expect Anne to be hostile not merely to
      the idea of his marriage in general, but to marriage with Ada in
      particular. It was hardly loyal to Ada, who should have reigned
      unchallengably queen; and he could offer Anne the argument of the
      advantages of being Peter Struggles&rsquo; son-in-law. But, with it all, he
      looked for friction, and Anne was not to disappoint him there, although at
      first she took it with a calmness which disarmed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came in, of course, late, and ate his supper, silently hoping that she
      would give him an opening, but Anne asked no questions, though she had not
      seen him since early morning, and Sam was not often out for meals. She
      asked no questions because she wanted to watch him first. It was clear to
      her at a glance that he was in one of two conditions: he was drunk or he
      was in love, and she wanted to make no mistake. If it was drink she would
      move very promptly and directly: if love, cannily and by devious ways. She
      found quickly that it was not drink. It was more serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her silence awed him. &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he asked by way of breaking it, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t
      you well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; she said grimly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m well. Are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve eaten a good supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I noticed that. I&rsquo;ll clear away now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a bit. I&rsquo;ve something to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon it&rsquo;ll keep till morning. You mayn&rsquo;t have known it, but you came
      in late. It&rsquo;s bed-time and beyond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like you to hear this tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sound serious,&rdquo; said Anne, and sat. &ldquo;What is it, Sam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something rather wonderful, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam rose, astonished at her perspicacity. &ldquo;You guessed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m none in my dotage yet.&rdquo; Anne was grim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, I hope you&rsquo;re pleased. You must be pleased. It&rsquo;s all so wonderful
      to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked you her name,&rdquo; said Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Ada Struggles. You know,&rdquo; he went on hurriedly, &ldquo;how much we all
      admire her father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, but I don&rsquo;t know Ada.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will soon,&rdquo; said Sam enthusiastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will that,&rdquo; said Anne, and there was menace in her voice. She took her
      candle. &ldquo;Good-night, my son,&rdquo; she said, kissing him, which was not
      habitual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;All that you have to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Ada yet,&rdquo; she said, and so was gone to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter and Anne went opposite ways in their search to know whether this
      marriage was the right thing for their children&rsquo;s happiness. Peter ignored
      the bread and butter problem, or took it for granted: and his was the
      higher wisdom. He knew that Sam was not made of the stuff that starves for
      bread; not in his body but in his soul was Sam likely to be pinched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne took the earthlier view that happiness resulted from home comforts.
      Ada, as she knew, was no shining beauty, and the better for that. Beauty
      is skin-deep. But she looked frail, only so, for the matter of that, did
      some of the toughest girls, and she took it that Sam had had the
      horse-sense to make some preliminary inquiries before he committed
      himself. Sam, it appeared, had not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was Ada strong and healthy? Was she economical? Could she cook? Was she
      her own dressmaker? And when she found that Sam could answer none of these
      questions, she said ironically: &ldquo;Well, at least, you&rsquo;ve eyes in your head.
      Is their house clean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam could only say that he supposed so, and Anne looked witheringly at
      him. &ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re in love all right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They say love&rsquo;s blind.
      You&rsquo;re leaving a lot to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he said, alarmed, &ldquo;what are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get acquainted with Ada,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;One of us must know
      her, and you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll be fair to her,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be fair,&rdquo; said Anne, and meant to be; but is a mother ever fair to
      the prospective wife of her only son? Perhaps, and in that case Anne went
      to Ada with an open mind. &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; she reflected, &ldquo;I daresay Tom
      Branstone&rsquo;s mother didn&rsquo;t think much of me, though Tom was one of ten and
      it makes a difference. It oughtn&rsquo;t to, though&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;she pulled
      herself up. &ldquo;Anne, you&rsquo;ll be fair to the girl.&rdquo; She looked indulgently at
      Ada&rsquo;s curtains and rang Ada&rsquo;s bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ada was wearing silver bangles on her wrists and her shoes were made
      for show. Anne had the sort of pleasure which comes from having one&rsquo;s
      worst fears realized. She may have generalized too sweepingly, but she
      held that only shallow people wear silver bangles and shoes whose aim is
      daintiness and not durability.
    </p>
    <p>
      First impressions, at any rate, went heavily against Ada, but Anne
      remembered her promise to be fair. It was possible that when Tom Branstone
      took Anne to see his mother, that lady did not like Anne&rsquo;s way of doing
      her hair. To each generation the symbols of its youth and perhaps bangles
      on Ada were not more skittish than a cairngorn brooch had been on Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have tea ready, Mrs. Branstone,&rdquo; said Ada. &ldquo;Sam told me you were
      coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he?&rdquo; Anne was surprised into saying. She had not told Sam of her
      intention and his guess at it and his warning of Ada had spoilt her plan
      of coming upon Ada unawares. She wanted Ada unprepared and unadorned: Ada
      at home, not Ada &ldquo;at home.&rdquo; And Ada was very much &ldquo;at home.&rdquo; The room had
      been &ldquo;turned out&rdquo;&mdash;and so had Peter that it might be&mdash;company
      manners and the company tea-pot were on exhibition, and everything was
      formal and obviously thought out. And, as Anne had to admit, not badly
      thought out either. Ada had not been to that expensive boarding school for
      nothing; she had an air to awe a porter&rsquo;s widow. Anne didn&rsquo;t like her
      trick of putting the milk in the cup before she poured the tea, nor her
      dogmatic way of asserting that it improved the flavour and that &ldquo;everybody
      did it now.&rdquo; Everybody, did not do it, Anne did not do it; but, again,
      perhaps this was the modern touch, and Anne had come to be fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made her first score when Ada left the room for hot water. &ldquo;This
      room&rsquo;s been dusted to-day,&rdquo; thought Anne. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what her dusting is
      worth.&rdquo; She put it to the test by running her finger along the top of the
      books on one of the shelves, and her finger was very black.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only way to keep books clean in Manchester is the way taken by nine
      out of ten people: they have no books. Some of the others put books behind
      glass, like orchids, the rest have the habit of blowing hard at a book
      when they take it from its shelf, and of washing their hands before
      opening it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne did not know that. She kept Sam&rsquo;s few books clean by daily
      elbow-grease, and now furtively wiped her dirty finger on her stocking
      with the feeling that she had found out Ada. The dust on the books (and
      certainly it was thick) confirmed the impression left by the bangles, and
      Anne was not in the least ashamed of her spying. Sam had stolen a march on
      her by warning Ada and she paid him in his own coin.
    </p>
    <p>
      And from then onwards the score rose steadily against Ada. There were
      cakes for tea. Now the only excuse for cakes was that one baked them
      oneself and Ada confessed that they came from Mrs. Stubbins and made the
      further mistake of showing an expert&rsquo;s knowledge in the productions of
      Mrs. Stubbins&rsquo; confectionery shop. &ldquo;Frivolous in food as well as dress,&rdquo;
       was Anne&rsquo;s comment. Her dress, Anne learnt, had been made by Madame
      Robinson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s dear,&rdquo; said Ada, &ldquo;but quite French. And, of course, she comes to
      church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No Nonconformists need apply; but Anne was thinking not of Madame&rsquo;s
      religion but her bills. The employer of a quite French dressmaker called
      Robinson, born Duff, was no wife for Sam Branstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      And by way of making Anne&rsquo;s assurance doubly sure, Ada let slip something
      about being under the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Anne was not sanguine. She saw clearly enough that it was precisely
      Ada&rsquo;s weakness which was her strength with Sam. Sam had been leant upon by
      Madge and George, and liked it, as Anne herself, in that case, had liked
      it. But that was a different case from this. Madge had the claim of
      sisterhood; Anne could see nothing in Ada and Ada&rsquo;s weakness to give her
      the claim to lean on Sam: and the leaning in marriage should not be
      one-sided. Ada could give Sam nothing except herself, and Anne did not
      think that gift worth having.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam, unfortunately, did and Anne doubted her power of changing his mind.
      Her first attempt, at all events, must be with Ada, and she felt cramped
      in Ada&rsquo;s house, for the reason, perhaps, that it was Peter&rsquo;s house, the
      shrine of his simplicity. She wanted Ada cut off from the defences of the
      tea-table and her own familiar surroundings, and saying something about
      the warmth of the evening, suggested a ride on the top of a tram-car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I often do it myself,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;It blows the cobwebs away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did it as a matter of fact not often, for so it would have lost its
      quality of a dissipation, but with a wise irregularity she escaped the
      thraldom of her house on a tram-car. Tram rides were her romance, her
      safety-valve, her glimpse at life. Six-pennyworth of tram is cheaper in
      the long run than fourpennyworth of gin: both carry one away, but the
      tram-car brings one safely back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne&rsquo;s lip tightened when she saw that Ada did not change the flimsy shoes
      and that her hat eclipsed their flimsiness. A &ldquo;baby&rdquo; hat, of imitation
      lace, from which her face peeped out like a drooping, sapless flower.
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; thought Anne. &ldquo;Men being men, that hat is clever. It&rsquo;s a trap for
      fools and it caught my fool. Ada Struggles, you&rsquo;re dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They took the front seat on the tram and aloud she said, using purposely
      her roughest accent: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer to think of our Sam marrying a lady. I&rsquo;m
      not saying he doesn&rsquo;t deserve it, but his father were a railway porter and
      mine were a policeman. His sister was in service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam wall get on,&rdquo; said Ada, with conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m none doubting it,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s had luck and it&rsquo;s a question
      if the luck&rsquo;ll hold. Mr. Travers took him up and sent him to Grammar
      School, and Sam didn&rsquo;t do too well there. He disappointed me and he&rsquo;s not
      gone on as he might have done. The fight&rsquo;s ahead of him yet and he&rsquo;ll need
      a fighter by his side. I&rsquo;ve done my share for him this long while and I&rsquo;m
      getting old. I shall be glad of a rest, Ada. Sam&rsquo;s an early riser and it&rsquo;s
      weary work getting up on a winter&rsquo;s morning to light the fire and get his
      breakfast ready. Only that won&rsquo;t trouble you. You&rsquo;re young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Ada, &ldquo;we shall have a servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Anne, &ldquo;on two pounds ten a week, with me to keep and
      all? I wouldn&rsquo;t reckon on that, if I were you. Later on, perhaps. But I
      know it can&rsquo;t be done at present, or Sam would have done it for me.&rdquo; The
      idea of Anne Branstone with a wench about her house struck her as
      humorous. Anne might have help some day&mdash;when she was bed-ridden:
      till then, her house was her house. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;you can take it
      from me that it&rsquo;ll not run to a servant. I don&rsquo;t know what his idea is
      about me, whether he will want me to live with you or not. Likely not. A
      man doesn&rsquo;t want his mother about when he&rsquo;s wed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; agreed Ada hopefully. Anne oppressed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. And I can get on with a pound a week from him. That&rsquo;ll leave you
      thirty shillings. Well, I&rsquo;ve done it, so I know it can be done, though
      mind you, it&rsquo;s a struggle all the time and double tides when the babies
      begin to come. But of course I&rsquo;ll help you&mdash;with advice. I&rsquo;m not for
      forcing myself on you, but naturally I know Sam&rsquo;s ways and his likings
      about food. He&rsquo;s a bit difficult at times, too, but that&rsquo;s nothing. All
      men are and you&rsquo;ll know that, having had your father to do for. I don&rsquo;t
      say Sam&rsquo;s finicky, but he likes what he likes and I hope you&rsquo;re fond of
      the same things. It always turned me up to clean a rabbit, and I never
      liked the smell of onions, but that&rsquo;s a favourite dish of Sam&rsquo;s and so I&rsquo;d
      just to grin and bear it. And I know you&rsquo;ll do the same for Sam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ada squirmed helplessly. She could have screamed. Anne sat at the outside
      of the seat and pinned her to it. The tram seemed a Juggernaut car which
      drove implacably over her dreams: a prison where she was tortured by a
      coarse old woman with work-roughened hands and an endless flow of vitriol.
      She wanted to tell Anne that she lied, that the more she deprecated Sam
      the more desirable Ada knew him to be, that her grapes were neither sour
      nor to be soured by Anne&rsquo;s insane jealousy; and she could not do it. The
      ride seemed more of a nightmare with every moment that passed. The tram
      was a mad wheeled cage with a mad driver and a mad guard. It left the
      lines and careered wildly into desolation, and she was fettered in it to
      an avenging fury who would not stop talking, but with ruthless common
      sense pricked all the bubbles of her hopes. She shut her eyes and
      abandoned herself to misery. Each minute seemed an hour. She thought that
      somebody was throttling her, that the flying cage was her tomb, that
      vampires sucked her blood, and her naked, drained body was shackled to her
      seat until the car, driving inevitably through black space, bumped finally
      against a star in one consuming smash. She opened her eyes to find that
      the tram had stopped at its suburban terminus and that Anne was asking:
      &ldquo;Shall we get down for a walk or shall we go back by the same car?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So she was still in the living world, and with the consciousness of it
      courage returned to her. For a minute she was silent, fighting her demons
      off, catching at facts and weighing them. Anne was not a vampire, but an
      old worn woman who had, curiously, the right to call Sam Branstone son&mdash;Ada&rsquo;s
      future mother-in-law, and a quaint one too; one to be put firmly and
      haughtily in her place and kept there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stay on this car,&rdquo; she replied. Its madness had departed. It was a
      tram, quite eminently sane and usual. &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;that you
      exaggerate the difficulties. I&rsquo;ve no doubt that Sam will have more money
      by the time we&rsquo;re married. You see, he has me to work for now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not a simper with it either. Pure matter-of-fact statement, and the truth
      of it hit Anne, the cool assumption that Ada as a spur to effort was more
      competent than Anne. And this to Anne who had learnt algebra for Sam, to
      Anne who had underfed herself that he might wear the clothes a Grammar
      School boy ought to wear, to Anne who&mdash;oh, it was ineffable, but it
      defeated her because she knew, bitterly, gallingly, but undeniably, that
      it was true. This baby-faced chit, this fool in petticoats was more to Sam
      than the mother who bore him. Queen Anne was dead and Ada Struggles
      reigned in place of her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X&mdash;GERALD ADAMS, SOCIOLOGIST
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>NNE called at
      Madge&rsquo;s on her way home. Madge&rsquo;s, in spite of George&rsquo;s progress, was still
      the house which had been the premises of the Hell-fire Club. Anne did not
      often go there and never without reason, but Madge was at a loss to know
      the reason of this visit, nor did she guess it when Anne unobtrusively
      dovetailed into The conversation about young Sam Chappie a question which
      might have seemed irrelevant. &ldquo;Have you done anything yet with that spare
      room of yours upstairs?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Madge. &ldquo;Nor likely to, I fancy.&rdquo; That was the reason of the
      visit. Anne was safeguarding her retreat, though she by no means admitted
      that it would come to a retreat. Engagements do not invariably lead to
      marriage. Meantime, hers was the waiting game and a rupture with Sam at
      this stage was to be avoided.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he asked her, not too confidently, if she did not agree with him
      about the wonder of Ada, she exercised a noble self-restraint, and all she
      said was: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not the wife for a poor man, Sam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sam thoughtfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d tumbled to that. And I don&rsquo;t mean to be
      poor either,&rdquo; and so went out to open the dark chapter of his bright
      success. He went to the Concentrics, not knowing that he was going to his
      fate. He went because it was the night of their weekly meeting and he had
      to go somewhere to avoid Anne&rsquo;s eye, but his mood was not concentric. &ldquo;I
      must get rich for Ada, rich for Ada,&rdquo; was the burden of his thought&mdash;so
      early did he justify Ada&rsquo;s words to Anne&mdash;and it was not a timely
      thought for a Concentrics evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had even forgotten that he had a special interest in this meeting,
      where the lecturer was to be Adams, once Sam&rsquo;s pet aversion and unbeatable
      rival at the Grammar School. He was reminded of it when he found himself
      accosted by a young man whom he could not at first identify.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jove! If it isn&rsquo;t Sammy Branstone! Are you a member of these fossils?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dubby Stewart!&rdquo; said Sam, as recognition dawned on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reed&rsquo;s here as well, somewhere,&rdquo; said Stewart. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a gathering of the
      clan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reed and Stewart, it seemed, were both members, which is to say that they
      had come once or twice some time ago and continued to keep up the small
      subscription from force of habit or through sheer weakness to stop paying
      it. Few societies indeed could exist were it not for the enthusiasm of the
      attending nucleus and the subscriptions of the nonattending mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We came to hear Gerald Adams make an ass of himself,&rdquo; Stewart explained.
      &ldquo;What a subject!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam had even forgotten what the subject was. &ldquo;Rich for Ada, rich for Ada,&rdquo;
       was still ringing in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject was &ldquo;Social Purity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which accounts,&rdquo; said Stewart, &ldquo;for the size of the audience. They&rsquo;ve all
      come hoping for the worst. I know I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The worst did not happen, or, rather, if it did, it was so skilfully
      disguised that nobody recognized it as the worst. It was easy to mistake
      it for the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adams was one part in earnest and two parts impish in the manner of the
      superior person who is out for an intellectual lark. He had a constant
      preoccupation with that which is known above all other questions as <i>the</i>
      social question. It was not a nice preoccupation for a young man: it was,
      for instance, remote from the healthy exuberance of Sam&rsquo;s Rabelaisianism.
      And, of course, Adams was wily: he wasn&rsquo;t the stuff of martyrdom. He
      enjoyed, as an intellectual gymnastic, the treatment of his subject so
      that it should at once shock his audience and win him their approval as an
      honest man doing an unpleasant job from conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam agreed with Stewart. His old prejudice against Adams was strong within
      him and he hoped Adams would come a cropper. That was at the beginning,
      when Adams, with an egregious affectation of superiority, began to read
      his lecture; but soon, quite soon, Sam changed his mind and hoped for
      nothing but that the skilful skater would keep his balance, on the thin
      ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rich for Ada,&rdquo; and here, as Sam saw it, was a &ldquo;stroke&rdquo; indeed if Adams
      were successful to the end and if at the end he would listen sensibly to
      Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adams was in little danger. He was of Oxford, London, the world, and his
      audience of Manchester. And he stooped to conquer with a lecture that was
      a mosaic of advances and retreats, of blazing indiscretions and smug
      apologies, of audacities and diffidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam watched the audience keenly, and it would not be unjust to say that
      the audience gloated. Not all of them gloated, but as a whole, as an
      audience, they lapped up Adams&rsquo; lecture like mother&rsquo;s milk. He called it
      frankness and gave unnecessary detail, he had an appearance of honest
      indignation and a reality of bathing in mud with relish. It was abominable
      but diabolically clever; indecent to the core, it artfully evaded anything
      to warrant a police court charge of indecency; it was foulness cloaked in
      piety, marching under the banner of Reform. He was a crusader in
      masquerade, flashing beneath their guard of British reticence a rapier
      whose hilt was a cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adams found a curious satisfaction in standing there, like a penitent at a
      Salvation Army meeting, pretending to an immense personal knowledge of
      evil which was, happily, impossible, and he delighted in the presence of a
      cleric in the chair. The thing developed, for him, into an exciting game,
      a contest of his wits with Peter&rsquo;s. He had carried his audience, but the
      chairman sat aloof and dubious. If Peter saw through him, he had lost; if
      not, he won. For Peter he read the condemnatory passages with vibrant
      earnestness, and for Peter he read as if reluctantly, conscience-impelled,
      the details of his evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam caught the infection, too, but hardly as a game. He hung on Peter&rsquo;s
      judgment with a deep anxiety, watched Peter flush and shuffle in his
      chair, saw him take snuff nervously, trembled at the moment when Peter
      seemed about to interrupt, sighed with relief when Peter sat back silently
      again and waited feverishly for the chairman&rsquo;s speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      There would probably have been little doubt about Peter&rsquo;s verdict had
      Adams been an ordinary Concentric, lecturer and a member of the Society.
      But he was neither, and was there by invitation. And he was not only of
      Oxford, Peter&rsquo;s University, but brilliantly of Oxford, of Balliol, with
      academic honours thick upon him. If Peter thought, as Adams spoke, that he
      ought to call him to order, he remembered that Adams was a Double First,
      and desisted. He couldn&rsquo;t be a hypocrite&mdash;because he had won the
      Ireland. He was terribly in earnest now&mdash;because he had won the Greek
      Verse Prize. He was single-minded, chivalrous, braving the misapprehension
      of the scurrilous, open and honest&mdash;because he was a Fellow of
      Balliol.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not matter to Peter that Adams&rsquo; father was the richest parishioner
      in St. Mary&rsquo;s; it mattered even less that Adams was exquisitely dressed in
      exactly the shade of grey appropriate to an ardent crusader. (&ldquo;Look at his
      damned clothes,&rdquo; Reed had whispered to Stewart. &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he thought it
      out?&rdquo; He had: his clothes were chaste if his lecture wasn&rsquo;t.) But
      scholarship did matter to Peter, whose other name was Charity, and once he
      had decided that Gerald was sincere, that all he said was subordinate to
      and justified by high purpose, he was generous, and the more generous
      because he had doubted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The subject of Mr. Adams&rsquo; lecture,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is like nettles: if it is
      not handled boldly, it stings. I have nothing but praise for the courage,
      the down rightness, the earnestness of his treatment of this distressing
      evil. I think that we have all been deeply stirred by his instances of
      man&rsquo;s inhumanity to women. As a churchman I feel a special responsibility
      and, may I say, a special gratitude to Mr. Adams for his study of this
      subject. Medicine, as we all know, has its martyrs, its research workers
      who sacrifice themselves for the health of their fellowmen. Mr. Adams, who
      has examined this social sore so thoroughly, at what cost in pain to
      himself only the most sensitive amongst us can guess, deserves to be
      ranked with the martyrs of science....&rdquo; And so on, doubly handsome because
      he felt ashamed of himself for doubting Gerald&rsquo;s honesty, and made amends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adams had won his game, hands down. He thought the old boy gloriously
      funny and he thought Sam Branstone, who rose when Peter sat down, funnier
      still. Sam believed in striking while the iron was hot: he didn&rsquo;t want
      Peter to have the opportunity of changing his mind when he came to think
      things over coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam began by congratulating himself on the good fortune that had been his
      in having been the school-fellow of the distinguished Mr. Adams. Adams
      gazed hard at Sam through his austere pince-nez and was observed
      perceptibly to start. &ldquo;Gad,&rdquo; he was thinking, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s that lout, the
      porter&rsquo;s son.&rdquo; But he liked Sam&rsquo;s flattery very well. Sam, it appeared,
      had been so deeply impressed by Mr. Adams&rsquo; admirable, indeed eloquent and
      moving address, and by the chairman&rsquo;s very just eulogy of it, that he
      thought it would be a tremendous pity if so arresting, so well-written a
      paper failed to reach a wider audience than that before which it had been
      read. They had been waiting for this paper; its appeal was wide; the
      urgency of its need, instinct in every word of it, was emphasized by the
      chairman&rsquo;s remarks. He had, therefore, a practical proposal to make. The
      paper ought to be printed, and if Mr. Adams could spare him a few moments
      after the meeting, Sam hoped that he would let him arrange the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down amongst great applause. Under its cover Stewart whispered:
      &ldquo;You inimitable ass!&rdquo; Sam looked at him in pained surprise. &ldquo;I want to see
      that paper in print,&rdquo; he declared indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The debate meandered in the usual futile way. Few had anything to say, but
      many liked the sound of their own voices and indulged their preference at
      length, till both speakers and talkers had taken their innings and Sam was
      able to go up to the platform. Peter had not changed his mind and was
      complimenting Adams in his simple, charming way.
    </p>
    <p>
      It ought, no doubt, to have made Adams thoroughly ashamed of himself, but
      it did not. It hardened his cynicism so that, when Sam came up, all he was
      thinking was: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gulled the parson. Now to bounce the porter&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Branstone?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Glad to meet you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I you,&rdquo; said Sam. They shook hands. &ldquo;Have you had time to think of
      what I proposed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a matter of fact,&rdquo; said Adams, which is the usual way of beginning a
      lie, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d thought of sending my little paper to one of the Reviews&mdash;the
      <i>Fortnightly</i> or the <i>Contemporary</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; said Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam could have kicked him. &ldquo;I venture to differ,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The chief
      object should be to reach as wide a public as possible. My own idea was to
      do it by itself in the form of a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he was going to say
      &ldquo;pamphlet,&rdquo; but altered it to &ldquo;brochure.&rdquo; He thought it sounded more
      attractive. &ldquo;In the heavy reviews it would be read by comparatively few,
      and it would not stand alone as in a brochure. It would take its place
      along with other articles. And I have heard that contributors to the
      reviews are not paid highly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adams had not thought of payment at all, but he thought of it now, with
      zest. He was rich, but the idea of despoiling the porter&rsquo;s son, who had
      had the assurance to go to school with him, struck him as the crowning
      move in a jolly game. This was, transcendently, his night for winning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said, which was true. &ldquo;I suppose I should get about
      twenty pounds for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give you twenty-five,&rdquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam!&rdquo; protested Peter. He approached the motive (as he understood it),
      but considered the offer reckless from a young man who contemplated
      matrimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-five pounds,&rdquo; repeated Sam firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; laughed Gerald, quite unable not to laugh at the idiot&rsquo;s
      persistence, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re as keen on doing good as all that, I&rsquo;ll take the
      offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll settle it at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went to the chairman&rsquo;s table and made out a form of assignment of
      copyright. He had a little knowledge of the law, and it was a dangerous
      thin&mdash;for the other fellow. But both Sam and Adams went home that
      night in a state of cherubic self-satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a game?&rdquo; thought Adams. &ldquo;And what an ass!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Curiously, the thoughts of Sammy Branstone were not dissimilar. He had
      this advantage over Adams: that Adams had read his paper and had not
      watched his audience all the time. Sam had watched the audience and
      thought twenty-five pounds a cheap price for that paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slept on it, and awoke next day with confidence in his investment
      undisturbed, but the news which awaited him at the office shook him at
      first. It was one thing to see a profitable side-line in the publication
      of Adams&rsquo; address and another to be suddenly obliged to regard the
      copyright of that paper as his one sound asset. He feared, in cold
      daylight, that it was not quite sound enough for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet what had happened did not come as a complete surprise. Sam knew
      Travers&rsquo; habits and knew that men of his habits are liable to die
      suddenly. Travers had died in the night, and Sam was very angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told himself that he had no luck with people&rsquo;s deaths. His father had
      died too soon for Sam, and now Travers was dead just when Sam had become
      engaged, and when he had undertaken a speculation which, however high his
      hopes of it, was after all speculative.
    </p>
    <p>
      An estate agent&rsquo;s business is largely personal and, if there is no obvious
      successor, no heir apparent already in training for the succession, is apt
      to fall to pieces when its head dies. The process of disintegration in
      this case had set in long ago; drink had begun what death now ended; and
      there was no heir. Lance Travers had decided for medicine and was, on the
      material side, little affected by his father&rsquo;s death, since Travers had
      bought him a practice a year earlier somewhere in the South, and the
      neighbourhood was proving healthily valetudinarian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The office was not a cheerful place that day. Men estimated their savings
      and balanced them against the probable weeks of unemployment before they
      found new places. A few of them, no doubt, might hope to &ldquo;go with&rdquo; the
      business to whomever bought it; and they wondered who would buy and which
      of them would be engaged by the purchaser.
    </p>
    <p>
      They fancied Branstone&rsquo;s chances, and so, in fact, did Sam, but it was all
      in the air and exceedingly disturbing just when he had given himself so
      much else to think about. Even if he did move with the business, it could
      only be as a clerk. He lost the advantage of Travers&rsquo; friendliness and,
      besides, he was not sure that anybody would think the business worth
      buying. Travers had no right to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the thought struck him that he was taking it lying down. He, a lad of
      mettle, was whining like these gutless clerks in the office. He was
      betraying his lucky star. Death, even Tom Branstone&rsquo;s, had not been
      forbiddingly unkind to him. Tom&rsquo;s death had led him indirectly to the
      office, to Minnifie, the Concentrics, Ada, and he began to see in Travers&rsquo; 
      death the possibilities of good. It might be the finger of fate, pointing
      him away from the office which had served its turn to a new dispensation
      to be arranged by the collaborators, Sam and Providence, upon the rock of
      Adams&rsquo; paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      They carried on the routine work of the office as men under sentence of
      death do little, ordinary things and find a solace in them. Then, late
      that afternoon, Lance Travers came. He had travelled since early morning,
      had been home, seen his father&rsquo;s doctor and his father&rsquo;s solicitor and was
      now come to see Sam. They sat in Travers&rsquo; private office, where the blinds
      were drawn, and in the presence of Travers&rsquo; son, who owed his life to him,
      Sam was conscious of a deeper feeling than he had ever known before, he
      was no longer angry because Travers had died, but mourned him honestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Lance presently, &ldquo;did my father ever tell you about his
      will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His will!&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;No. Why should he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought he might have done,&rdquo; said Lance. &ldquo;He made it last year after he
      bought me my practice. He thought then that he ought to do something for
      you, but he didn&rsquo;t expect to live long and he put it in his will. There&rsquo;s
      a thousand pounds for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam took it nicely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that he were still alive;&rdquo;
       and, at the moment, he meant it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had been right. It was the finger of fate.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI&mdash;UNDER WAY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>S a simple matter
      of course, Lance offered Sam the first refusal of his father&rsquo;s business,
      but was not surprised when Sam declined to think of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam was far more surprised at himself than Lance at Sam. Lance had never
      looked upon estate agency as a desirable profession, whereas Sam had been
      bored with its routine without losing his respect for its utility, and
      only yesterday he would have jumped at the chance of owning the business.
      He heard with astonishment the sound of his own voice politely refusing
      the offer, but having refused he did not tamper with his swift decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is, one supposes, that what might be called the quick-firing part
      of his intelligence had absorbed and reacted to the fact of his thousand
      pounds before the whole of him was properly aware of it. At any rate, he
      refused, and, on reflection, approved his refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      His speculation in Gerald Adams wore a different aspect now that he was a
      capitalist. &ldquo;Money,&rdquo; as he had remembered once before, &ldquo;breeds money,&rdquo; and
      he doubted if Travers&rsquo; business, robbed of Travers&rsquo; genial personality,
      were fecund enough for the pace of money-breeding he anticipated. Perhaps,
      too, there was something in the thought that the Travers&rsquo; agency was dead
      man&rsquo;s shoes, while, win or lose, the idea of publishing Adams&rsquo; lecture was
      his own invention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing that happened to him with his legacy was the feeling that he
      had regained caste; he belonged again with his old school-fellows. &ldquo;How
      many of them,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;can lay hands at a moment&rsquo;s notice on a
      thousand pounds?&rdquo; and walked erectly through the street where, naturally,
      since he had not met him in eight years until last night, he encountered
      Stewart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo,&rdquo; said Stewart, &ldquo;how&rsquo;s the patron of letters? And would a drink be
      any use to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam hesitated. Did the way to the society of the Olympians lie through the
      doors of the public-house? Stewart was undeniably Olympian: he had the
      air, the manner, the clothes of well-assured success. He had a lightness
      and a poise that excited Sam&rsquo;s envy. He had style, this youth who might be
      anything, but who, Sam cynically thought, had probably not paid for his
      distinguished clothes, while Sam was the owner of a thousand pounds. He
      was, thereby, Olympian in quiet fact, which need not be shrieked from the
      house-tops, as Stewart had, apparently, to shriek. Sam <i>was</i>, and
      there was the possibility that Stewart only appeared to be. It gave him
      strength to refuse. Not from principle, but from economical prejudice Sam
      was a teetotaller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t take alcohol,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s never too late to mend,&rdquo; said Stewart. &ldquo;Still, there&rsquo;s a café here,
      and we&rsquo;ll drink coffee. It&rsquo;s bad for our hearts, but Balzac wrote the
      &lsquo;Comédie Humaine&rsquo; on black coffee, so there may be something in the vice,
      though it isn&rsquo;t a habit of mine. Two black coffees, Sophie,&rdquo; he ordered
      from the waitress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t a habit of yours,&rdquo; asked Sam, &ldquo;how do you come to know the
      waitress by name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My dear ass!&rdquo; said Stewart pityingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call them all Sophie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only when it&rsquo;s their name. Your name is Sophie, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said as the
      girl returned with their coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stewart appreciated Sam&rsquo;s astonishment. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m showing off, but I
      like it. If you see a girl with an idiotic silver brooch made up of the
      letters <i>SOPHIE</i> you can assume that it&rsquo;s her name, and not the name
      of her best boy. Simple, when you know how it&rsquo;s done, like all first-rate
      conjuring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t noticed her brooch,&rdquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had. That&rsquo;s the difference. Still, it isn&rsquo;t fair to blame you. I&rsquo;m a
      professional observer.&rdquo; Sam took Stewart to mean that he was a detective,
      but hadn&rsquo;t time to ask for confirmation, because Stewart asked instead:
      &ldquo;And what, by the way, are you?&rdquo; And threw him into some embarrassment by
      the question. What, indeed, at the moment was he?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t your observation tell you?&rdquo; he fenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It told me last night that you&rsquo;re a considerable lunatic. Did you buy
      that stuff of Adams&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought I saw you in the act as I went out. Obviously, then, you&rsquo;re a
      tripe merchant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;whether you could help me, Stewart. Seriously, I
      mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the tripe trade?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want very much to meet a journalist.&rdquo; He thought a detective ought to
      know journalists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear fellow, this is a café. It isn&rsquo;t a bar. What do you want a
      journalist for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell that to the journalist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want to start a paper and you&rsquo;re looking for an editor, you
      needn&rsquo;t look further than me. There have been candid moments in my life
      when I have called myself a journalist. At present, I edit the <i>Manchester
      Warden</i>, but I&rsquo;m open to conviction.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t quite edit that paper&mdash;yet,
      but reported for it at six pounds a week. He did not know shorthand, but
      he quoted Joseph Conrad and Henry James, correctly and incongruously, when
      he wrote a notice of a music-hall performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said Sam astutely, &ldquo;that when I said a journalist, I meant
      something very different from you, but I will tell you how I stand and
      perhaps you will advise me. Last night, as you know, I bought Adams&rsquo; 
      paper. I gave him twenty-five pounds for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lunacy,&rdquo; said Stewart, &ldquo;is a mild word for your complaint. Twenty-five
      shillings would be a top price for it in a friendly market.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day I reached the office to learn that my employer had died suddenly.
      You remember Lance Travers? It was his father, and with his death, for all
      practical purposes the business comes to an end. Well, you see my
      position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stewart quoted Sheridan: &ldquo;&lsquo;The Spanish Fleet thou canst not see, because
      it is not yet in sight.&rsquo; And much the same applies to your position, my
      lad. Its postal address is the Womb of Time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;And I may add that I am engaged to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can admire thoroughness,&rdquo; said Stewart. &ldquo;You omit none of the
      essentials.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, with it all,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still too proud to go to Adams and ask
      him to let me off my bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it wouldn&rsquo;t be any use if you did,&rdquo; said Stewart. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d laugh at
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can believe it of him. But I&rsquo;m landed with his paper. It has cost me
      twenty-live pounds. I meant to print it, and I mean to print it, but I
      mean now to sell it when it is printed.&rdquo; Sam left Stewart to suppose that,
      had Travers not died, he would have distributed that pamphlet free.
      &ldquo;Money,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;is a necessity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had taken the right line. Stewart&rsquo;s instinctive generosity was touched,
      and he meant to give this lame dog a lift over the stile. &ldquo;I see where
      your journalist comes in. All right, Branstone, you can count on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On you?&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t ask it of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t ask,&rdquo; replied Stewart naively. &ldquo;I offer. I may edit the <i>Manchester
      Warden</i>, but Zeus nods sometimes, &rsquo;busmen have been known to take a
      holiday, and there is a paper called the <i>Sunday Judge</i> in whose
      chaste columns I have written under the name of Percy Persiflage. Send me
      a proof of that pamphlet and Percy shall stamp upon it. He will say that
      no decent person could read it without being revolted, and the pamphlet
      will boom. It&rsquo;s the Sunday-paper public that you want, and... No, Percy
      shall not stamp. Percy shall bless. He will be moved to admiration of Mr.
      Adams&rsquo; earnestness, he will applaud the high moral purpose, and will do
      the rest by correspondence. Get your sisters and your cousins and your
      aunts to pitch in letters on either side, and I&rsquo;ll see they get printed. I
      make this alteration because of the bookstalls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bookstalls?&rdquo; asked Sam vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This problem of distribution,&rdquo; said Stewart impressively, &ldquo;is the most
      difficult question of modern life. The producer is here, you; the consumer
      (we hope) is everywhere, and the problem is to bring your pamphlet to the
      thirsting consumer. The answer is the bookstall, but the bookstalls are
      cautious. When I say bookstalls I mean the right bookstalls. You will
      never see your money back if the only bookstalls which will exhibit your
      pamphlet are those which sell atrociously printed paperbacked editions of
      &lsquo;Nana&rsquo; and &lsquo;Fanny Hill.&rsquo; You must flourish on <i>the</i> bookstalls, and
      they banned &lsquo;Esther Waters.&rsquo; The bookstalls, Branstone, are going to call
      for tact, and tact shall begin with Percy&rsquo;s appreciation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or earlier,&rdquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Earlier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of the bookstalls, but this may help there, as well as
      in other ways. I mean, as far as Manchester is concerned, and if we get it
      on the stalls here, they can&rsquo;t very well refuse it in other places.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manchester being Manchester, it isn&rsquo;t likely,&rdquo; said Stewart. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your
      idea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only this,&rdquo; said Sam, and showed him his proposed cover for the pamphlet.

      THE SOCIAL EVIL
    </h3>
    <p>
      Being an Address
    </p>
    <p>
      By Gerald Adams, M.A.,
    </p>
    <p>
      Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Read before the Concentric Society with The Rev. Peter Struggles in the
      Chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stewart looked at it, then he looked at Sam, and Sam seemed to him very
      little like a lame dog now. He whistled loudly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get your money
      back, my lad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But this is rough on Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Struggles approved of the lecture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if he will approve of this?&rdquo; said Stewart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t go back on his word,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Besides, I&rsquo;m engaged to his
      daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thing that troubles me,&rdquo; said Stewart admiringly, &ldquo;is that I took you
      for a harmless lunatic. I&rsquo;m only a journalist myself, with one foot in the
      <i>Manchester Warden</i> and the other in the <i>Sunday Judge</i>. I&rsquo;m a
      Tory on Sundays and a Liberal on weekdays. I gave up honesty when I gave
      up being young, and I thought I knew the ropes by this time. But when I
      think that I took you for a guileless innocent, I want to go into a corner
      and kick myself hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam found this rather alarming he knew that his use, or misuse, of Peter&rsquo;s
      name was cunning, but began to regret that he had shown Stewart his pro
      posed cover. &ldquo;But I get my review in the <i>Judge?</i>&rdquo; he asked hardily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said Stewart, &ldquo;you do. I&rsquo;ve spent sixpence on coffee and half an
      hour on you. There&rsquo;s good copy in this and I can&rsquo;t afford to waste it.
      I&rsquo;ve my living to earn, and Gerald Adams deserves the worst he&rsquo;s going to
      get. At the same time, I&rsquo;ll allow myself the luxury of telling you that
      yours is a lowdown game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t make the world what it is, did we?&rdquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And neither you nor I will leave it any better than we found it,&rdquo; said
      Stewart, prophesying rashly with the boundless cynicism of his twenty-five
      years. &ldquo;The worst of coffee,&rdquo; he went on, finishing his cup, &ldquo;is that it
      makes you thirsty. I&rsquo;m going across the road for a drink. Do you have one
      with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I have to see a printer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. Well, why not the Judge Press? I daresay I could get you in
      there on the ground floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they are not quite the right people for this. They print sporting
      papers, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll die from overheated bearings in your brain-box,&rdquo; said Stewart.
      &ldquo;You think of everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam had, at least, thought that a printer (however obscure by comparison
      was the Judge Press, whose works were a small town in themselves) who
      issued a religious paper was better for his purpose than the printers of
      the <i>Sunday Judge, Sporting Notions and the Football Times</i>. He went
      to Carter, Meadowbank &amp; Co., who were on the verge of bankruptcy, but
      had the advantage of printing <i>Christian Comfort</i> and the <i>Church
      Child&rsquo;s Weekly</i>, and arranged with them to print five thousand copies
      of Adams&rsquo; paper. Carter, who was the whole firm, looked askance at the
      title, but when Sam pointed out that the Rev. Mr. Struggles had approved
      of the contents, Carter succumbed at once, and did not even attempt a
      protest when Sam instructed him to print on the whole five thousand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This first edition of one thousand copies is issued at sixpence. The
      price for future editions will be one shilling. Samuel Branstone,
      Publisher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carter&rsquo;s dingy office was decorated with the chief products of his firm,
      texts, the stock-in-trade of commercialized religiosity. Well handled,
      there was money in texts, but Carter was an old man with declining powers
      and a conservative mind. Meadowbank, who had looked after the distributive
      side of the business, was lately dead, and Carter&rsquo;s nightly prayer was
      that the concern might last his time. As things were promising, it seemed
      unlikely, but here was Sam with an order for him and no disposition to
      beat him down in price. Carter did not like the instruction to describe
      five thousand copies as one thousand, and he didn&rsquo;t like the subject of
      the pamphlet, but he wanted business, and he couldn&rsquo;t conceive of a pirate
      sailing under the flag of Mr. Struggles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam rammed that home, feeling the man&rsquo;s hesitation. &ldquo;I think it probable,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;that Mr. Struggles will preach a sermon on this pamphlet.
      Perhaps I might tell you that I am going to be his son-in-law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That settled Carter, and he took the order. He knew, and was sensitive to,
      the influence of Peter Struggles, curate. He knew that in the parish of.
      St. Mary&rsquo;s, Peter&rsquo;s smile counted for more than the vicar&rsquo;s weightiest
      word, and that while the vicar was unknown outside his parish, Peter had
      authority throughout Manchester&mdash;an authority which had lately growm
      through Peter&rsquo;s refusal of preferment to an easy living in the country. It
      hadn&rsquo;t, of course, been Peter who had told of that refusal, he had not
      told Ada. But it had leaked out, and Manchester, which despises
      selflessness in men, honoured it in the curate; Mancunians were flattered
      by his loyalty to St. Mary&rsquo;s and by the thought that they were fellow
      citizens to saintliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emphatically, the name of Peter Struggles on the pamphlet was a <i>clou</i>,
      but Sam had not told Peter of it yet, and he must do it. He could not
      afford an accident, and Peter, he considered, was manageable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ada met him at the door with a bright smile, and raised expectant lips,
      but he shook his head, touch ing her shoulder tenderly, and passed in
      front of her into the room so that, when she followed, her face expressed
      the anxiety he desired. He entered himself as a man crushed by grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Sam?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter closed &ldquo;Plotinus&rdquo; reluctantly: he never found time enough for
      reading, and here was one of his few evenings interrupted. He had the
      thought, feeling it ungenerous, that interruptions of this kind would end
      when Ada was married.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had sad news to-day. Mr. Travers died in the night. It&rsquo;s... it&rsquo;s
      rather a blow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter disdained priestly conventionalities. &ldquo;He was a good friend to you,
      Sam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A second father,&rdquo; said Sam carefully, not taking the opportunity of
      telling that Travers&rsquo; friendship had lasted beyond death. Perhaps he
      thought this moment too sacred for the intrusion of a legacy. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo;
       he went on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had all day to think of it, and of the difference this
      will make to me&mdash;to us, that is, Ada, for you and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What difference, Sam?&rdquo; she asked sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It comes to this,&rdquo; he said dejectedly, &ldquo;that I am out of work and
      competition is so desperate. While he lived, I had his friendship behind
      me. Now&mdash;I don&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m afraid to stand alone. No doubt it will
      be good for me eventually, but, Ada, you see how it may postpone our
      hopes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ada saw it. &ldquo;Plotinus&rdquo; took that opportunity of slipping from Peter&rsquo;s
      knee, and Peter saw it, too, and sighed. &ldquo;Oh, Sam!&rdquo; said Ada.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said Sam, looking at Peter with a fine affectation of guilt, &ldquo;there
      is my recklessness of last night. In my then circumstances, it was
      extravagant. To-day it looks worse than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Peter kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Sam agreed. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t know, and I have the feeling now that I must
      abide by what I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very proper, Sam, but Mr. Adams is not poor and I should think that if
      you were to go to him&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;please don&rsquo;t press me to do that. A bargain, I
      feel so strongly, is a bargain and should be kept at all costs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter felt silently ashamed of himself. &ldquo;You are perfectly right,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s how I feel, but in a sense I&rsquo;m landed with the
      thing and I propose to go on with it. As I see it&mdash;and I know there&rsquo;s
      a certain amount of inappropriateness in thinking at all of these
      practical affairs with my benefactor so recently dead, but I must, I must&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       he looked at Ada and it was understood that his thought for her excused
      all&mdash;&ldquo;As I see it, it&rsquo;s a case for going on and trying to pull the
      chestnuts out of the fire, so to speak. I shall print that paper, and the
      good that I hoped to do will not be lost because my circumstances have
      altered, but I shall make a small charge for it to cover expenses as far
      as possible. And as I naturally want it to sell well, I had the idea of
      stating on the cover that it was first read at the Concentrics under your
      chairmanship. The point of that is that all the members were not there
      last night; it will call their attention to it; and they will, I hope,
      buy. It makes certain of a few reliable purchasers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite, quite,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an excellent idea. Though I can hardly
      suppose that mention of my name has any value, the name of the society
      should certainly help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His modesty was quite incurable. He had not the faintest notion of the
      wide-spread influence of Peter Struggles. &ldquo;I have thought of little else
      all day but Mr. Adams&rsquo; paper. I wondered if it was my duty to speak of
      this terrible subject from the pulpit. The Church ought not to be silent
      or it may be thought to acquiesce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam felt his heart leap within him. &ldquo;Adams thought frankness best,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, at the Concentrics. But there are difficulties for me, and
      perhaps I shall speak only to the Young Men&rsquo;s Class at the-Sunday School.
      Though that,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;is perilously near to compromise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is it?&rdquo; asked Ada. &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam was silent. So was Peter, and the silence grew till he felt it a
      reproach. He looked at Sam. &ldquo;You see?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That is the dilemma of
      the Church. I shall speak to the young men, and, after that perhaps,
      perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He glanced at Ada.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he finished decidedly, &ldquo;I must leave it at that.&rdquo; He was fifty-six,
      and most of his life had been lived under Victoria the Good.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII&mdash;DROPPING THE PILOT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>NNE lived for Sam:
      and if she rarely showed it, if, for instance, it appeared sometimes that
      she lived to make her house the cleanest in the row, that was no more than
      a symptom of her stoicism. She lived for Sam, and he knew it. She belonged
      to a race which hates ostentation like the devil and keeps its feelings
      veiled behind a grim reserve. It conceals emotion as a hidden treasure and
      wears a mask which strangers take to indicate a want of sensibility. She
      had not the habit of caressing Sam; she chastened whom she loved; and Sam
      was very well aware of the strength of Anne&rsquo;s love.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was ready, at the proper time, to give him to the proper woman, but
      she held that Ada was not the woman nor this the time. She was ready to go
      her ways from Sam, and from life itself, when he made a marriage of which
      she could approve, but she was not ready to leave him to Ada Struggles of
      whom she disapproved. She was not ready to die for the likes of Ada
      Struggles. Let Sam marry Ada, and Anne, meant to live, because some day he
      would have need of her and, when the day came, she would be there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Sam would have been pleased if he could have told Anne about the
      pamphlet and the legacy. He had hoped after the Minnilie affair that his
      next &ldquo;stroke&rdquo; would be one of which he could tell Anne, but he did not see
      this as tellable. She would naturally ask what the pamphlet was about, and
      if Peter could not speak of it to his daughter, Sam could speak of it even
      less to his mother. And as to the legacy, what was the use of mentioning
      that to a woman who would point out that security was only to be had with
      two and a half per cent? Which wasn&rsquo;t at all Sam&rsquo;s notion of the uses of a
      thousand pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, he was grown up and a man does not tell his mother everything.
      But unless he is a fool, he tells her the things which she is bound in any
      case to find out, and if he had foreseen the certainty of her finding out
      he would, not being a fool, have told her these. He did not foresee,
      because Anne did not read newspapers, but she had neighbours who did and
      who told her, with comments, of the storm which presently broke out in the
      columns of the <i>Sunday Judge</i>, and of Mr. Travers&rsquo; will, which
      received a small paragraph in the paper when it was proved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a time when you and me didn&rsquo;t go in for secrets,&rdquo; she said to
      him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve not had much to say to me of late and I&rsquo;ve not seen much of
      you, either, with the hours you&rsquo;re keeping, but I&rsquo;d put it down to love. I
      know a man&rsquo;s not rational when he&rsquo;s courting, but it seems there&rsquo;s a lot
      about my son that I&rsquo;ve to learn. Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me about Mr. Travers?
      Did you think I&rsquo;d steal the money off you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not, mother, but I meant to come to you with a finished tale,
      not one that&rsquo;s only just begun. I&rsquo;m engaged in a business affair of which
      I was going to tell you when it was complete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Yes</i>,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I see. You&rsquo;re risking your money. If you came out
      on the right side, you&rsquo;d tell me about it, and if you lost you&rsquo;d forget to
      tell me. Are you losing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s early days to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then maybe I&rsquo;m still in time to nip this in the bud. What&rsquo;s this about
      the <i>Sunday Judge?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I Have you seen it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye. You&rsquo;re the talk of the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s splendid,&rdquo; he let slip before he was aware of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid! There&rsquo;s a gentleman writing to the paper to say that you&rsquo;re
      trading in immorality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wrote that letter myself,&rdquo; grinned Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I shall never make you understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt you won&rsquo;t. Lying to me like that. Expecting me to believe you
      write to the paper about yourself and call yourself hard names. And the
      letter&rsquo;s signed &lsquo;Truth-teller,&rsquo; too. It&rsquo;s printed in the paper that my son
      has lifted the lid from the cesspool and let loose a smell to make decent
      people vomit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I know. Advertising is a coarse art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name&rsquo;s blackened for ever. And it&rsquo;s my name, Sam, and the name your
      father gave me. It&rsquo;s the name of honest folk and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, mother, don&rsquo;t I tell you that it&rsquo;s all advertisement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you tell me and what I can believe are coming to be two different
      things. I know what an advertisement in the paper is and I know what a
      letter is. This is a letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam felt the hopelessness of further argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a simple-minded faith in the integrity of newspapers and the
      printed word, but he could at least show that the word could contradict
      itself. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a letter, and so is this.&rdquo; He took a
      copy of the paper from his pocket. Stewart had kept his word, no great
      feat since he had a good idea of what his editor supposed the Sunday
      public to want, and a column of fervent correspondence flared under the
      heading of &ldquo;The Social Evil.&mdash;Is the Pamphlet Justified?&rdquo; Sam chose a
      letter which described Adams as a crusader and Branstone, his publisher,
      as a high-souled social reformer courageously risking misapprehension for
      principle and the right, calling the endorsement of the Rev. Peter
      Struggles to witness in proof of his irreproachable motives. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said
      Sam, &ldquo;am I to be misapprehended after all, and by you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me you wrote the other letter,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you mean that
      you wrote this one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said truthfully. He wrote his, attacking himself, on one
      side of Stewart&rsquo;s desk, while Stewart at the other defended him. It had
      been great fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;is the business affair you say you&rsquo;re engaged on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said unguardedly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t misapprehend at all, my son. I apprehend very well. And
      you&rsquo;ve worked Peter Struggles into it. Was that why you got engaged to
      Ada?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;Doubt me if you like, but you must not doubt Mr.
      Struggles. He surely is above suspicion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s keeping bad company just now,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;and I doubt you&rsquo;ve been
      too clever for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam chose to be offended. &ldquo;Is that what you think of me?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you&rsquo;re clever. Aye. I think that all right. I&rsquo;ve known it since the
      time when you tricked a parcel of schoolboys out of a house of furniture
      and put George Chappie into it. You&rsquo;re clever in the wrong places, Sam.
      When you were at school, you were clever out of school. You&rsquo;re at business
      now and you ought; to be clever in honesty, and I&rsquo;ve the notion that
      you&rsquo;re being clever in dishonesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this only shows how right I was not to tell you.
      It&rsquo;s the old story. Women don&rsquo;t understand business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. Business is a pair of spectacles that makes black into white, but
      I don&rsquo;t wear spectacles myself. Are you going to tell me what you&rsquo;re doing
      with that thousand pounds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you it isn&rsquo;t decided yet. But if the sales of that pamphlet go up
      this week as they did last, I&rsquo;m going into the publishing business with
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that you can publish more of the same sort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can get them. There&rsquo;s a lot of money in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; she said earnestly, &ldquo;is that all you&rsquo;re caring about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me yourself that Ada was not the wife for a poor man.&rdquo; He
      considered that a very neat score, to seem to make Anne responsible, but
      Anne was not to be deceived by any such seeming. As she saw it, Ada had
      corrupted Sam, Ada was the motive of this misuse of his cleverness; and
      the bitterness for Anne was doubly poignant. She believed in Sam, with a
      faith which had never swerved in spite of her disappointment in his school
      career; but she realized now that he had been marking time in Travers&rsquo; 
      office, that it was Ada and not she who had quickened his energies to
      rapid action. Ada had quickened them, where under Anne they had lain
      dormant but the quickening had been corrupt. It came from Ada, poisoned at
      the source, and took to poisonous ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had touched bottom now and reached essentials. &ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I
      was joking like when I said a man&rsquo;s not rational when he&rsquo;s in love. But it
      was a true word spoken in jest. You&rsquo;re not rational or you wouldn&rsquo;t be
      doing these things and making a byword of the name of Branstone, and the
      reason you&rsquo;re not rational is Ada. If you were in love with a good woman,
      you could no more do dishonourable things than fly. But you&rsquo;re in love
      with a bad woman and it leads to bad results. Sam, do you think I like to
      tell you that you&rsquo;ve made a mistake? And do you think I don&rsquo;t know? Lad,
      lad, I love you, and I&rsquo;ve never reckoned myself a fool. Choose now, I&rsquo;m
      not the sort of fool to be jealous just because you get wed. I&rsquo;d none be
      jealous of the right lass, Sam. I&rsquo;d take her and welcome her and know she
      had a better right to you than me. But Ada Struggles has no right: she&rsquo;s
      mean and grasping and she&rsquo;s small in every way there is. She&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, mother. Don&rsquo;t forget that I am marrying Ada.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And nothing that I say will alter you? Sam, she&rsquo;ll go on as she&rsquo;s begun
      by sending you to this.&rdquo; She put her hand on the lurid polemics of the <i>Sunday
      Judge</i>. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll drive you down and down. You may make money and you may
      be rich, but there&rsquo;ll be a curse on your riches and on all you do, and Ada
      Struggles is the name of the curse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam attempted a small levity. &ldquo;That will be all right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
      going to change her name.&rdquo; Anne shook her head. &ldquo;A change of name&rsquo;ull none
      change Ada&rsquo;s nature. It&rsquo;s the best part of your life that&rsquo;s before you,
      and life with Ada spells ruin. I&rsquo;m not telling you what I think. It&rsquo;s what
      I know, and I ask you, Sam, to heed my words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m heeding them,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I know you&rsquo;re wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the last you&rsquo;ve got to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry we don&rsquo;t agree, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreeing&rsquo;s nowt,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m nowt against your happiness. See,
      Sam, I&rsquo;ll prove it. There&rsquo;s a thought at the back of your mind that I&rsquo;ve
      nothing against Ada but a grudge because she&rsquo;s come between you and me. I
      say that girl&rsquo;s no good for you, and I say I&rsquo;ll do anything to force you
      to see it. There&rsquo;s nowt of myself in this and maybe this will make you
      believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a good fire in the room and she put her hand into it. Sam was
      alert enough to drag her away before much damage was done, and he had oil
      on the hand in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fuss,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;but tell me what you think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;re plumb crazy&mdash;with jealousy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not craziness, but fanatic devotion to an idea: and the idea was
      Sam, Sam&rsquo;s happiness, Sam&rsquo;s future. She put her hand into the fire hoping
      to convince, and she would have sat on the fire if she had thought the
      larger act would carry a fuller conviction. But he did not need to be
      convinced that she objected to Ada; the point was that her objections were
      unfounded, and, in the face of Ada&rsquo;s sublime and stunning merits, idiotic.
    </p>
    <p>
      One cannot put a hand into the fire without suffering for it, and Anne was
      suffering acutely. Her face was drawn with pain and her lips were
      trembling uncontrollably, but her voice was firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done my best to save you, Sam. If you&rsquo;ve nothing better to say than
      that, you and me have come to a parting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve come,&rdquo; and turned his back on her. He thought she
      would come round, that she would get over her attack of frenzied jealousy.
      It was idle threat to talk of a parting. Why, she was dependent on him,
      and in more ways than one. He housed and kept her, but, more than that,
      she needed him. His presence was the breath of life to her. He knew that,
      and he let her go!
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, he thought she would come back, with a sharp lesson well
      learnt. She had to learn that he was grown-up, of an age to act for
      himself and choose and think without her tutelage. Only, she did not come
      back. She went to Madge and stayed with Madge; and the terms on which she
      stayed were her terms. &ldquo;I furnish the room,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I pay you a
      rent for it. Also, I pay for what I eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paid. At the age of fifty-two the mother of Sara Branstone, of
      Branstone and Carter, and the mother-in-law of George Chappie, of the
      Chappie Window-Cleaning and Bill Posting Company (a smaller affair than
      its name, but the source of a regular five pounds a week), was a charwoman
      on three days out of the seven, and it was not lack of offers which
      limited her to three days, but the fact that she paid her way on three
      days&rsquo; result. She kept other people&rsquo;s houses as clean as she had kept her
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was suggested to George Chappie that it was hardly decent in him to
      allow his mother-in-law to go out charring at her age&mdash;a prosperous
      man like him. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he was reported to have replied, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ve tried
      all ways we can. But you can&rsquo;t argue with Mrs. Branstone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s one of the old sort, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; said his gossip, who, perhaps,
      endured a mother-in-law of another kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that,&rdquo; said George succinctly.

      CHAPTER XIII&mdash;THE INTERMITTENT COURTSHIP
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>NLY by long
      service does one become an artist, but one becomes married by a simple
      ceremony. It is the tragedy of marriage, which is the most difficult of
      all the arts, that most people come to it without apprenticeship. Perhaps
      the popularity of widows as brides is due to the fact that the widow is a
      widow: that she has been broken in to marriage: that she has not
      everything to learn: that one, at any rate, of the contracting parties, is
      expert. There is much to be said for the policy of the &ldquo;trial trip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courtship, if intimate enough, may be a fairish substitute, bowdlerized,
      as it were, for a &ldquo;trial trip,&rdquo; but when Sam married Ada he knew pitiably
      little about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought that she was wonderful. Not only had he to think it, but he
      actually did think it. He had to think it because only for a prodigy among
      women could he have treated his mother as he did. He had thought her crazy
      when she put her hand into the lire, but he knew it was heroic. If she
      were crazy, it was for love for him, and at the core, he loved her too and
      felt ashamed of himself, but Ada stood between them, and he was not going
      to give up Ada. Then he was busy, time wore on, custom blunted the prick
      of conscience, and it finally became a habit either not to think of Anne
      at all, or to think comfortably of her as happy enough with Madge.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he actually thought Ada wonderful because the conditions of his
      courtship fought for her. He was visibly prospering; he liked prosperity;
      it was Ada who had initiated his prosperity; and she was glamorous for
      that. Again, he was very busy in those days with the first steps of his
      new business, too occupied to play the diligent lover, and saw her very
      fitfully. So seen, she did not lose the wonder of surprise, but came upon
      him freshly with each of their meetings, able to parade for each some new
      attraction from her slender stock of charm. She kept their intercourse
      egregiously correct, and he thought her mystery was infinite. She hid her
      shallowness behind affected modesty, knowing that an intimate courtship
      would discover to him that there was nothing to discover, and attracted by
      aloofness. It was immensely clever in its short-winded way: a cleverness
      that lasted the course of courtship, but evaporated when the tape&mdash;the
      altar&mdash;was reached. It did not seem necessary to Ada to go on being
      clever once that ring was on her finger. She was married, she had
      achieved: she was clever for the spurt, and had no cleverness left, for
      the Marathon Race. And Sam had many preoccupations in those days which
      prevented him from thinking too much about Ada.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he was dull about his courtship, his wits were sharp enough for other
      matters. He had the satisfaction, almost from the day of its issue, of
      seeing the pamphlet sell steadily. Very quickly it ceased to be a case of
      getting his money back, and became merely a question of how many cents per
      cent he was going to make. His first edition of five thousand (the <i>soi-disant</i>
      thousand) was rapidly exhausted, and the presses of Carter Meadowbank
      worked overtime to cope with the demand. He cast bread upon the waters by
      sending copies to every name in the Clergy List and every Member of
      Parliament; and did not cast in vain. Free advertisement was lavished upon
      him. Somehow, he had found one of those times when the social conscience
      is stirred: he published, without knowing it, opportunely, and the
      diabolic cleverness of Gerald Adams&rsquo; writing steered him safely past the
      rocks of the Public Prosecutor. It seemed only to stimulate demand when he
      raised the price to a shilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no further trouble with the pamphlet. It sold itself, but sitting
      still watching the wheels go round did not appeal to Sam, who had a
      thousand pounds to multiply. He hadn&rsquo;t quite the hardihood to believe that
      he could multiply his thou sand as rapidly as he had the twenty-five which
      he paid Adams, but he felt that he was launched as a publisher and had
      nothing to publish.
    </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts were diverted from that solecism one day when he went into
      Carter&rsquo;s printing-office to speed up the foreman. The foreman admitted
      that the pace could be improved. &ldquo;But I dunno, sir, that the boss wants it
      improved. There&rsquo;s nothing in to follow this job of yours. You might say
      you&rsquo;ve been the saving of Mr. Carter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam was thoughtful for a minute. He had not looked upon himself as the
      saviour of Mr. Carter and did not appreciate that character when it was
      thrust upon him. He went into Carter&rsquo;s office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This little tract of mine,&rdquo; he said (&ldquo;tract&rdquo; seemed the light description
      in that text-hung room), &ldquo;is selling remarkably well, and the demand
      increases. Now, I&rsquo;ve nothing to say about the past.-I came in here a total
      stranger and you quoted me accordingly. But it&rsquo;s only fair to warn you
      that I have gone into prices with other printers and I may find it
      necessary to make a change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carter made no effort to hide his dismay. &ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t do that, Mr.
      Branstone. At least, give me a chance of revising my price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once bitten,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;is twice shy, and you don&rsquo;t deny that you bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely business,&rdquo; argued Carter, &ldquo;is business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Sam grimly, &ldquo;and if you&rsquo;ll answer me a few questions on the
      understanding that this is a business interview and I&rsquo;m not being
      impertinently inquisitive, I shall be obliged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best,&rdquo; said Carter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. How old are your printing-presses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consequently they are almost hopelessly out of date?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carter had a tenderness for those presses. They had been young when he was
      young, were bought when the world smiled on him and his business had its
      hedyay. They had kept him and he could not be disloyal now. &ldquo;I believe
      that they have printed your tract efficiently, Mr. Branstone,&rdquo; he defended
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s life in the old dogs yet,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not proposing to
      make scrap-iron of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As they belong to me,&rdquo; said Carter tartly, &ldquo;it would not make such
      difference if you did propose it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t propose it&mdash;yet. Please remember that
      I&rsquo;m talking business. Do you care to tell me what that text cost to
      produce and what you get for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carter did not care, but, though he wondered at himself, he told. &ldquo;And
      that?&rdquo; Sam asked, pointing to another; and again Carter told.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;there are two religious papers which you print for the
      proprietors. What&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; interrupted Carter, &ldquo;are you proposing to buy my business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sam coolly, &ldquo;only to become your partner in it. What profit
      were you going to tell me you made on the papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carter told: he was too stupefied to do anything else. &ldquo;Um,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;It
      isn&rsquo;t much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are a good work,&rdquo; said Carter, and Sam looked at him sharply, but
      the old man was perfectly sincere. It was good work to print religious
      magazines and he did it for next to nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;thank you. Now I won&rsquo;t mince matters: When I came along
      with my&mdash;tract, I enabled you to postpone filing your petition, but
      it was only a postponement, and if you&rsquo;ll look facts in the face the one
      big fact for you is bankruptcy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord will provide.&rdquo; Carter had lived from hand to mouth for many
      months in that belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like to look at it that way. He has provided: He has provided me.
      I will make you a good offer, Mr. Carter. I will introduce five him dred
      pounds capital into the business for a halfshare in the plant, goodwill
      and future profits of this concern. That is, the printing business. What
      I, as publisher, do has nothing to do with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;... I must think it over,&rdquo; said Carter; but they both knew that he had
      already decided to accept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord,&rdquo; Carter was thinking, &ldquo;<i>has</i> provided.&rdquo; Sam, on the
      contrary, was thinking, &ldquo;I may or may not be a fool to go into this
      without getting an accountant&rsquo;s report on the books, but I believe in
      rapid action, and if I&rsquo;d offered too high a price I&rsquo;m certain that he&rsquo;s
      imbecile enough to have told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It remained to find something to print, and he wanted Stewart&rsquo;s advice,
      but, with the idea of being first on the side of the angels, went to see
      Peter Struggles. The battle which had raged round the pamphlet had left
      Peter untouched, even though more than one of the clergy who received it
      from Sam had thought it their duty to write to Peter&rsquo;s bishop. The bishop
      failed to see a case for disciplinary measures: Peter might have been
      sinned against but he had not sinned. And the <i>Sunday Judge</i> was read
      by neither Peter nor his bishop. (The Church is notoriously out of touch
      with modern life, but, after all, it is hardly reasonable to expect the
      Church to compliment its rival, the <i>Sunday Press</i>, by reading it.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, Peter had, on reflection, felt some wavering doubts about
      the pamphlet. His intermittent shrewdness threw a flickering light through
      the haze of his charity and gave him moments of discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam&rsquo;s attitude during this call was admirably calculated to resolve his
      doubt. He wanted, with an eye to the future, to make sure of Peter, whose
      name he might require another day, and was ready, even if it were not
      immediately profitable, to placate Peter now. He explained that he had
      joined forces with Mr. Carter, and at once acquired merit in Peter&rsquo;s eyes.
      Carter was irreproachable. He did not explain by what means he had been
      able to join Carter and it did not occur to Peter to ask. Sam was not
      going to tell Peter, who would tell Ada, of his legacy. If she found out,
      as Anne had found out, he could not help it, but, meantime, it was his
      secret. Ada, like Anne, belonged to the sex which had no understanding of
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the point,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;with a business like Mr. Carter&rsquo;s, is to use
      it for good. I take it that the texts do good, but perhaps they are only
      for the simple-minded. I hope I don&rsquo;t despise people for their simplicity,
      but my own taste runs rather to books and I think you will agree with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter agreed, with a quotation which rather dashed Sam; he had an idea
      that poetry did not sell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Poets are the trumpets which sing to battle. Poets are the
      unacknowledged legislators of the world.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Quite so. But isn&rsquo;t poetry going to the opposite
      extreme? I had the thought of something more direct. Good prose with a
      good moral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; said Peter, off again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Were not God&rsquo;s laws,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      His gospel laws, In olden time held forth
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      By types, shadows and metaphors?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course they were,&rdquo; said Sam, wondering when Peter would close his
      mental dictionary of quotations and come down to business, &ldquo;and that
      quotation is very apt because I was thinking of classics. English
      classics, you know,&rdquo; he explained hurriedly, &ldquo;and classics because they
      are not copyright.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have stood the test of time,&rdquo; said Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Do you think you could propose a list? I should like to know that
      the first books I publish had been selected by you. I don&rsquo;t think they
      ought to be exactly theological, but they must be good in every sense of
      the word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not begin with the book from whose in traduction I just quoted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not indeed?&rdquo; said Sam, who hadn&rsquo;t the faintest idea of the source of
      the quotation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;Suppose you put that down for one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Same made vague scratches on paper. He had a bookish reputation to sustain
      and he was not going to betray ignorance prematurely. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Feter,
      &ldquo;there is Law&rsquo;s &lsquo;Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m letting myself in for something,&rdquo; thought Sam, but he wrote it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The Imitation of Christ,&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Little Flowers of St. Francis,&rsquo;&rdquo;
       Peter went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think those should be enough to begin with,&rdquo; said Sam hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Peter, recapitulating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The &lsquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress &lsquo;&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;(&ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; thought Sam, &ldquo;I
      needn&rsquo;t give myself away.&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, four,&rdquo; he interrupted, reading the now completed list. &ldquo;And I am
      very much obliged to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wasn&rsquo;t, though, quite sure about it. He had &ldquo;nobbled&rdquo; Peter, but he
      feared those books would be a millstone round his neck. There might be a
      steady sale for the &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress&rdquo; as a prize, but the others&mdash;&mdash;!
      Still, he need not print many copies of them, and&mdash;consoling thought&mdash;they
      would be good window-dressing tor his list. He hoped it would include
      other, very different, books.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Ada is out,&rdquo; Peter was saying, and Sam was rather startled to
      realize that he had not missed her. But he was sure of his position with
      her: it was his position for her which he had to consolidate. He proceeded
      to consolidate it by going in search of Stewart, and found him where he
      expected to find him, in a bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want your advice,&rdquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whisky for the gentleman, Flora,&rdquo; said Stewart. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my advice and
      you&rsquo;ll get no other till you&rsquo;ve taken this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam took it. Business is business and, beyond that, his thrifty prejudices
      were less necessary now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not unteachable,&rdquo; said Stewart. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a point in your favour. The
      proper thing when you&rsquo;ve drunk that is to ask me if I will have another.
      My reply will be in the affirmative and we shall then retire, with
      sustaining refreshment, into that corner, where I will advise you for as
      long as you can continue to buy whisky for me and drink level. I hate a
      shirker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam told him of his partnership with Carter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always troubled about
      you,&rdquo; said Stewart. &ldquo;I can never make up my mind whether you&rsquo;re too clever
      to live or whether you were born with luck instead of brain. Obviously,
      you will publish novels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are so many kinds,&rdquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Only two. Mine and the rest. But I suffer from honesty. Therefore I
      tell you that my novel has been refused by every publisher in London. It
      is waiting,&rdquo; he said hopefully, &ldquo;for a man with courage. The difference
      between it and the Yellow Book is that my book <i>is</i> yellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;But I have gone into the publishing trade to make my
      living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the whole,&rdquo; decided Stewart, &ldquo;you are more knave than fool. And you
      would call it the publishing trade. It&rsquo;s a benighted world, but there are
      still some publishers who aren&rsquo;t in trade&mdash;beyond the midriff. Do you
      seriously come to me to ask what sort of novels to publish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sort,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that is written for nursemaids by people who ought
      to be nursemaids.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s jealousy,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;They get published and you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Stewart. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve always heard that seeing
      is believing. Do you ever go to the theatre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity, because if you did, I&rsquo;ve a tragedy in blank verse that you
      might care to publish. It is great art and will never be produced. Still,
      I&rsquo;m a philanthropist to-night and you will come to the theatre with me. I
      happen to be going for the <i>Warden.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a dramatic critic for the <i>Warden?</i>&rdquo; asked Sam, rather awed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a reporter, old son. This isn&rsquo;t the kind of play they waste a critic
      on. Drink up, and we&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam found, to his relief, that he was able to go and decided he had a
      strong head. The theatre was crowded when they reached it and Stewart was
      young enough to sit self-consciously in one of the two seats kept for the
      <i>Manchester Warden</i>. Dramatic criticism was taken seriously on that
      journal; at least two of the paper&rsquo;s regular critics were men of genius,
      and Stewart hoped that he might be mistaken for one of them. But the
      audience that night was not the kind which interests itself in the lions
      of the higher journalism; rather it justified the contemptuous reference
      to drama as the &ldquo;art of the mob.&rdquo; It would have made a sincere democrat
      weep for his convictions. &ldquo;Behold them,&rdquo; said Stewart. &ldquo;The Public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam beheld them more than he beheld the play. He reminded himself that he
      was there on business, to be shown something which Stewart wanted him to
      see, and if he had not the gift of detachment, he assumed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Adams had read his paper to the Concentrics, Sam had listened but
      kept his eyes on the audience. In a darkened theatre, the audience was
      more difficult to watch, but he could feel its quick response to the play,
      could hear its ready laughter and its quite eager ears. Emphatically, here
      was a play which seized its audience, gripped them, tickled them,
      beslavered them, throttled them, did with them what it liked and when it
      liked; all to their immense and vociferous delight. He tried to keep his
      aloofness, to see how it was done, to tear the heart out of this mystery.
      Here was something which the public wanted; he had only to diagnose it,
      and the Open Sesame to fortune was his.
    </p>
    <p>
      He couldn&rsquo;t do it. Detachment slipped from him, never to return till the
      curtain fell. He wasn&rsquo;t a superman, immune from other men&rsquo;s emotions. The
      play took hold of him and swayed him with the rest. He tried resistance,
      vainly; told himself that he was here, not, as these others were, for
      pleasure, but to learn, to learn; and the play gripped him the harder for
      his attempt to take it coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end, Sam was applauding wildly while Stewart watched him with
      cynical amusement. &ldquo;Caught you all right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and by way of a
      confession I&rsquo;ll own that the damned thing nearly got me once. Rum place,
      the theatre, isn&rsquo;t it? But,&rdquo; he grew more serious, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve to write about
      that, write without being libellous about that maudlin, sentimental,
      erotic, religious trash. It&rsquo;s enough to make a man give up journalism and
      take to something honest, like coal-heaving. But I&rsquo;m forgetting. I brought
      you here to teach you something. Have you learnt it? That&rsquo;s a play, but
      the same thing applies to a novel. You find novels with &lsquo;The Sign of the
      Cross&rsquo; in them, my boy. Queasy sentimentality to sicken a bee, and, for
      the rest, don&rsquo;t forget that Jesus died for you to make money out of
      novels. This play makes me blasphemous, but I&rsquo;m doing the devil&rsquo;s advocate
      to you to-night, so it&rsquo;s all in the picture. When I&rsquo;ve finished my notice
      I think I&rsquo;ll try a &lsquo;short&rsquo; on &lsquo;The Tradesman Publisher&rsquo; or &lsquo;The Dignity of
      Letters.&rsquo; It will be good for my conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll reply to it, with a list of the
      classics I am going to publish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; said Stewart, &ldquo;you rather sicken me. I am speaking of the <i>Manchester
      Warden</i>, not the <i>Sunday Judge</i>. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the vacillations of a journalist with a foot in two camps and an
      idealistic standard which he hardly pretended to take seriously himself
      left Sam unimpressed. The play and Stewart&rsquo;s description of its essence
      had given him furiously to think. He imagined that he knew the sort of
      novel he wanted and he was not troubled by Stewart&rsquo;s disease of dual
      standards. Sam had one standard, the success standard; and anything else
      was muddle-headedness. At the same time he felt most grateful to Stewart
      who had advertised the pamphlet and now presented him with a policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a policy, but not one for immediate application. <i>Festina lente</i>
      was his watchword for the moment, and he devoted himself to putting new
      life into the sales of texts and to the issue of the &ldquo;Branstone +
      Classics.&rdquo; They were, one might note in passing, the Branstone + Classics:
      his name loomed large and the names of their authors, the insignificants
      like à Kempis and Bunyan, were properly small; and he put the sign of the
      cross between the Branstone and the Classics. He intended it to be his
      trade-mark, and if it were his trade-mark, why not use it? It infringed
      nobody&rsquo;s copyright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst it all, he had little enough time for Ada, and she knew how much
      she gained by being a luxury instead of a habit. But Sam was not engaged
      for the sake of being engaged, and as soon as he knew he had made no
      mistake in his business venture was eager to be married. There were no
      objections from Ada. This intermittent courtship, in which his duties as a
      lover took second place to his activities as a business man, suited Ada
      well, but marriage, finality, the bond suited her better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even to the end of that engagement it was things for Ada which preoccupied
      him, rather than Ada herself, and he took the matter of furnishing
      seriously&mdash;from a business point of view, interested less in the
      furniture he bought than in the discounts he might, by this means or that,
      secure. He suffered the usual surprise at the cost of mattresses and
      kitchen equipment, but, to Ada, he appeared royally lavish. Ada did not
      know of his legacy: she knew that Anne had told her on the top of a
      fantastic tram-car that Sam had earned two pounds ten a week with Travers,
      and the scale of this furnishing did not square with what a man could save
      out of two pounds ten a week. It followed in Ada&rsquo;s mind that Anne had lied
      to her, malignantly misrepresenting Sam&rsquo;s position to frighten her; and
      the breach between Anne and Ada, which never had much chance of closing,
      was permanently open.
    </p>
    <p>
      One does not have old connections with an estate agency without being able
      to rent a good house cheaply. She was going to be mistress of a house
      which fell little short of the dreams of her boarding-school days. It was
      certainly &ldquo;stylish&rdquo;; she was not sure that it was not positively &ldquo;smart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madge wept on the night before her wedding. Ada did not weep. She was too
      busy hugging herself because she had surmounted the perils of courtship.
      She had accomplished her aim in life. She was going to be married.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV&mdash;HONEYMOONERS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>DA was married in
      white satin, though Peter sold books to do it and her trousseau lacked
      essentials. It depends, though, on one&rsquo;s point of view. Ada thought white
      satin essential, while another might have put underclothing first. But it
      is fitting to wear a crown at a coronation and, when the object of one&rsquo;s
      life has been to get married, to celebrate in satin the attaining of one&rsquo;s
      aim.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also reminded the congregation that the bride is the central figure at
      a wedding. People might otherwise have remembered that they did not come
      because Ada was Ada, but because she was Peter&rsquo;s daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She entered with <i>réclame</i> into the state of being Mrs. Samuel
      Branstone, resenting a little the tweeds of Stewart, Sam&rsquo;s best man, but
      liking his manners and liking, too, the way in which Sam took it for
      granted that the day was hers, not his. He did not even obtrude a family.
    </p>
    <p>
      George was, in fact, obscurely there, hidden among the congregation. He
      was there in the spirit of schoolboy, playing truant from Anne, who was at
      home with Madge. Ada thought that the conspicuous absence of Branstones
      added lustre to her satin. None but the necessary Sam was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went to London, where neither of them had been before, and since it
      is a bitter thing to have to look back to a boring honeymoon, the choice
      of place had great discretion. There was so much besides themselves to see
      in London that they postponed looking at each other till they came home.
      They saw sights and went to theatres, but though they slept together and
      rose together and saw the sights (all but one) together there was no
      realization of &ldquo;togetherness,&rdquo; no birth of a new life in which they were
      not Sam and Ada, but these two in one. They were furiously modest about
      things which no honeymooner has any right to be modest about. If they are
      modest about them, they have no right to be honeymooners. It may have been
      in their case something both worse and better than modesty. It may have
      been downright shame. Perhaps subconsciously they knew that this was not a
      marriage, not the coming together of two fit mates. It had no passion in
      it. There was self when they should have been ecstatically selfless. They
      were two when they should have been most one.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sam, if he fell immensely short of ecstasy, was still too much under
      her spell to be critical. He wondered a little at the frank delight in
      being married which she displayed in public, at her flaunting of her new
      wedding ring, at her advertisement that this was a honeymoon, and
      contrasted this outward relish with her intimate frigidity; but even this
      seemed a disloyalty, and he told himself that Ada in a hotel was one
      person and at home would be another. Ada would &ldquo;settle down,&rdquo; and meantime
      they were in London, and London was waiting to be explored with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They explored chiefly the London which Londoners do not know, the London
      of the guide-books, and felt tremendously metropolitan because they went
      to the Tower, the British Museum and the National Gallery. The shops
      seared Ada. Their windows fascinated but their doors repelled. Probably
      Sam would have held her back by main force had she attempted to go in,
      but, as it was, she had the same satisfaction in identifying them that
      social snobs find in recognizing, at a distance, famous people. These were
      the authentic shops which advertised in the papers and they had a game
      called &ldquo;hunting the Harrod&rdquo; or &ldquo;looking for Barkers,&rdquo; which led to a lot
      of fun with &lsquo;buses after they had quartered Oxford Street and Regent
      Street. It was all very gay, and gayer, almost naughtily gay, to go one
      night to a place called the Coliseum&mdash;a music-hall; a thing to do
      audaciously, not to be spoken of at home; and yet the place was very full
      of really most respectable people. They marvelled at the emancipation of
      the Londoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his honeymoon, Sam became possessed of an ambition. It was not an
      extraordinarily fine ambition, but he came to care about, it greatly and
      it repaid his care a thousandfold. The way to sanity is to desire very
      keenly something which it is just possible one may get, and Sam&rsquo;s ambition
      kept him sane in the days when he knew that Ada had failed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Struggles had suggested to our debater of the Concentrics that he ought to
      see the House of Commons at debate, and had written to their local Member
      for a pass to the Gallery. The result was the most thrilling experience of
      Sam&rsquo;s honeymoon! It was, for one thing, unique that Ada could not be with
      him: these were the first hours since he married her that they spent apart
      and perhaps that, all unconsciously, had gilded them for Sam. They had
      almost a tiff before she let him go: not quite, but she resented his
      desertion of her and considered it his fault that she was not allowed to
      sit with him to hear the legislators who made laws for her as for him. Not
      that Ada cared who made her laws, nor cared to watch the makers at their
      work, but she managed to put enough snap into her resentment at his going
      to lend the added quality of a stolen pleasure to his experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      That gallery, with its foreshortened view of the dingy cock-pit, is not
      the first choice of the connoisseur in thrills, but on Sam its effect was
      amazing. He must have had some gift, quite undisclosed till now, of
      veneration, for it is almost beyond belief that the reality of the House
      of Commons can impress. But the idea can and perhaps (to be just) the
      reality is more impressive than that of any other Chamber on earth.
      Imagination helping him, it caught and held his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small stout man of undistinguished appearance was speaking in a
      conversational tone not easy to hear from the Gallery, but presently the
      orator warmed to his subject and poured out living words in a spate of
      real emotion. He was one of those rare men, and this one of those rare
      speeches, that really convert an opponent: and Sam&rsquo;s ambition to speak as
      this politician spoke, and from those benches, came instantly to birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only did he want to be a Member of Parliament, but a Liberal Member,
      because this man of words was Liberal. Up to this time, Sam had not been a
      political animal although he had voted, and voted Tory because that was in
      general the line of Mr. Travers and the property-owning class he
      represented. Now with a swift enthusiasm he was Liberal, knowing nothing
      of either side, but caught by sudden hero-worship for a little, pudgy,
      snubnosed politician who spoke in sentences of prodigious length and never
      lost his way in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a twinkling he acquired the bias of the politician: his hero&rsquo;s opponent
      was palpably a fool; he had no gifts, no argument. Yes, Sam was doubly
      right to be a Liberal. They had so obviously all the brains, they were so
      undeniably the winning side. He did not understand the technique of a
      division and was surprised when he looked at the paper next day to find
      that the Liberals were outvoted. It gave him pause, but did not shake him.
      When the Liberals came back to power, as with their superiority in brain
      they were certain to do, he, Sam Branstone, would come with them. Let it
      be only a year or two and he would be ready. He too would loll upon those
      padded benches, and catch the Speaker&rsquo;s eye, and be an orator.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked along the Embankment towards his hotel, and it came into his
      mind that he had spent four hours in the Gallery and had not thought of
      Ada. Nor could he, though he tried, think of her now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sky-signs still flashed across the river, and as he paused and leaned
      against the parapet a young policeman kept a wary eye on him. But Sam was
      meditating life, not death. The lights of London gleamed upon the Thames
      and made it magical for him. He conquered London in his reverie, and
      stepped, a member, from the House to his automobile. His home, he
      supposed, was somewhere in Park Lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought back now to the theatre where he had seen <i>The Sign of the
      Cross</i>. It was different from the London Theatres he had seen where
      audiences seemed afraid of emotion. Or was it that the plays had not been
      right? That was it: they had not the note: they weren&rsquo;t&mdash;what was
      Stewart&rsquo;s phrase?&mdash;erotic religious plays. He wanted to move
      audiences as that play had moved its audience. Power! The power of the
      spoken word. That was the thing, and since he could not write a play he
      must rely upon himself, his oratory, his single voice. He saw himself on
      platforms facing crowded halls, gripping his hearers, leading them where
      he would, taming the mob till it made an idol of its master. As to where
      he would lead, why, he would lead and that was what mattered. Branstone
      was Prime Minister that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one o&rsquo;clock before the young policeman felt at liberty to resume
      his beat, and Sam left the enchanted river for his little hotel in Norfolk
      Street. Ada had her back to him and apparently she slept. Actually she was
      wide awake; she was wondering whether it had happened to any other woman
      to be treated so abominably on her honeymoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      She brushed her hair nest morning with a notable viciousness. Hair has
      uses beyond those of mere adornment. It is an admirable veil through which
      one can watch without being seen to watch. Ada was watching Sam and she
      was also listening to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She listened not because his enthusiasm for the House of Commons
      interested her, but because she was waiting for some word of apology. It
      did not come. He was full of regret, but only because this was their last
      day in town and he could not go to the House again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time is our train?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I have time to do some shopping first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shopping?&rdquo; he asked, but unsuspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. Sam was going to pay for his pleasures. Those blouses she had
      seen at Peter Robinson&rsquo;s no longer seemed impossibly expensive. If Sam
      chose to enjoy himself in his own way, without her, she would enjoy
      herself in hers&mdash;with Sam to pay the piper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shopping is a loose term; one shops when one buys a kipper or a diamond
      tiara. Ada was putting her hair up and he imagined her to mean that she
      wanted a packet of hair-pins. &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he said pensively. &ldquo;And while you
      go, I think I will just slip down to the House of Parliament again.&rdquo; The
      House would not be sitting and he could not get in. He knew that, but he
      wanted to gaze, to look at the frame which was some day to contain him. He
      wanted to be certain that it was still there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you will come with me to the shop. I shall want
      you there to pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam paused in the act of fastening his collar. &ldquo;To pay?&rdquo; he asked, not
      unsuspiciously now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are your selfish pleasures all you think about?&rdquo; Ada wanted to know.
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a privilege to be allowed to buy me nice clothes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had not looked upon it in that light. In budgeting for their future he
      had indeed assumed that a trousseau lasted a bride for her first year. &ldquo;I
      see,&rdquo; he said gloomily; then remembering that he was in love with her, &ldquo;of
      course,&rdquo; he added with a smile which might count to him for heroism. &ldquo;But
      we must not forget the fares, and after I have paid the bill here I shall
      not have more than two pounds left to spend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I spend two pounds on blouses,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a monosyllabic noise which might have been &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; It might also
      have been &ldquo;Damn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The truth was that he had deliberately kept those two pounds back,
      intending to spend some, but not, he hoped, all of it, on a present for
      Ada. He had thought of a hand-bag, had imagined her gasp of delight when
      he audaciously entered with her one of those forbiddingly inviting shops,
      her appreciation of his generosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last night had driven the thought entirely from his mind, and he was
      annoyed now not only at his forgetfulness, but at Ada. She did not ask,
      she demanded. A night in the Gallery may be regarded as dissipation, but
      at least it is not a crime. It is even patriotic, and he was asked to foot
      a bill for two pounds as the price of his patriotism. Ambition, he
      thought, would be an expensive luxury if he had to pay in clothes for Ada
      every time he went to a political meeting. For that, plainly, was her
      attitude: she demanded a <i>quid pro quo</i>: she announced a policy of
      retaliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a queer perverted pleasure in scratching an open wound, in
      cutting off one&rsquo;s nose to spite one&rsquo;s face. He had meant to be generous
      and he wanted still to be generous, but the money he had laid aside for
      generosity was now hypothecated to meet her claim. He would give her her
      pound of flesh, but wanted very badly to roast it for her with coals of
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gloom lifted from him suddenly. He took off the old tie which he had put
      on as being good enough to travel in, and fastened very carefully one
      which he had bought &ldquo;for London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; he was thinking. &ldquo;It is&mdash;almost&mdash;a stroke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At breakfast he was positively gay, so that Ada wondered furtively what he
      was up to, and whether the way to raise his spirits would always be to
      demand new clothes of him. It did not seem likely, but she proposed at any
      rate to experiment freely in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He divided his attention between her, breakfast, and the Parliamentary
      report of the <i>Times</i>. He felt that he had virtually participated in
      that debate, and even the shock of reading that the division had gone
      against his hero did not spoil the pleasure he found in reading of it. He
      read with a prophetic eye. He, too, would be reported in the <i>Times</i>
      some day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called the waiter. &ldquo;Marmalade, sir?&rdquo; asked the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks. Bring me the directory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The directory,&rdquo; protested the waiter, &ldquo;is in the reading-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Sam superbly, &ldquo;am in the coffee-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The waiter brought him the directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam smiled broadly. He was testing his form, and decided that if it were
      equal to coercing a waiter into carrying a directory to his
      breakfast-table, it would probably not fail him in what he proposed to do.
      He consulted the book and noted an address which was not, he observed, in
      Park Lane. His respect for Sir William Gatenby suffered a slight decline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later he rang the hell of that gentleman&rsquo;s house. Gatenby was
      the local member, to whom Peter Struggles had written for Sam&rsquo;s pass to
      the Gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir William in?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; A trained eye observed his clothes. They were not
      cut in Savile Row.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will see me,&rdquo; said Sam serenely. Some people are at their best in the
      early morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      His card was accepted from him, and he was shown into a library of severe
      Blue Books, possibly qualified by a reproduction of Millais&rsquo; portrait of
      Gladstone. Ordinarily, Sam would have been met in the library by a
      secretary who earned his salary by his talent for administering polite
      snubs to unwanted callers. The secretary was not earning his salary
      to-day, but, probably, spending it. It was Derby Day.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, a vote is a vote, and Sir William came in with a show of
      geniality. &ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Branstone,&rdquo; he said, reading Sam&rsquo;s card.
      &ldquo;From the old town. I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all you remember about me?&rdquo; asked Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the moment,&rdquo; confessed Sir William warily. His majority was not large.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;the Reverend Mr. Struggles is my father-in-law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said Sir William. &ldquo;I am very glad you called. How is Mr.
      Struggles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;T left him well, thank you. Perhaps you remember that he wrote to you to
      ask you for a pass to the Gallery for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was happy to be lucky in the ballot,&rdquo; said the Member.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;I went last night. But I mentioned that to establish my
      identity. My object in calling upon you is to ask you to lend me five
      pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir William thought of his secretary, who should have saved him this.
      Thinking of his secretary, he thought of Derby Day and the probable
      intentions of a man who chooses that day to ask for a loan. &ldquo;My dear sir!&rdquo;
       he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; agreed Sam. &ldquo;Life would be unbearable to you if every constituent
      who came to London tried to borrow money off you. But I am Branstone. I
      run the Branstone Press and the Branstone Classics. I published the
      &lsquo;Social Evil&rsquo; pamphlet and sent you a copy which, I regret to say, you did
      not acknowledge.&rdquo; Sir William thought again of his secretary, and
      unkindly. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;is merely to indicate that I am a man of
      substance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir William Gatenby wore side-whiskers. He was an old man and there was
      little left of him besides pomposity and a determination to hold his seat.
      He looked, what at this moment he felt, some one in a farce. He was quite
      sure that Sam was some one in a farce. They were both in a farce, and of
      course five-pound notes fly in farces like gnats in August. It did not
      seem to him that there was anything to do but to produce a five-pound
      note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Sam, and sat at a desk. &ldquo;I will give you my cheque for
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It staggered Sir William. He nearly warned Sam of the danger of issuing a
      cheque which was not likely to be honoured, but refrained in time. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;there was really no need for you to come to me at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;that I wanted you to remember me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I shall do that,&rdquo; said Sir William.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Sam calmly. &ldquo;I wanted to know you because I intend to go
      into politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Cause,&rdquo; said Sir William solemnly, &ldquo;demands his best from every
      earnest worker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will work for the Cause,&rdquo; said Sam. Neither of them attempted to define
      the Cause, and Sam left without further remark, but his call had this
      result: that on finding the cheque honoured Sir William wrote to his agent
      to tell him of &ldquo;a queer fish called Samuel Branstone who called on me the
      other day, and offered to work for the Cause. A young man whom I think you
      should encourage. He is the son-in-law of Mr. Struggles, and the Church,
      alas, is so tepid towards our great Principles that we must not neglect a
      promising recruit from that fold.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XV&mdash;OTHER THINGS BESIDE MARRIAGE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>EBT appeals to
      some people. They feel that when they are in debt they have had more out
      of life than life owes to them. Sam had given Gatenby his cheque and was
      therefore not in debt to him, but he proceeded to spend the five pounds as
      recklessly as if it had been borrowed money.
    </p>
    <p>
      He meant to astonish Ada, and succeeded, but the surprise he sprang did
      not work quite as he anticipated. For a moment, indeed, as he bought her
      hats and blouses she glowed with unaffected gratitude, and he tasted with
      her the joy of headstrong acquisition. But Ada&rsquo;s glow was quick to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had time in the train to forget the splendour of his presents and the
      dash that she would cut next Sunday, and to remember that he had spent a
      lot of money; he who denied that he had more than two pounds to spend had
      spent seven. Obviously, he had lied to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was true, she thought, that he had repented of his lie and of his
      meanness, and bought handsomely: the more handsome the purchase, the more
      demonstrable the lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recalled her dreadful interview with Anne, Anne&rsquo;s statements of his
      means, and how little they conformed to the scale of Sam&rsquo;s furnishing. She
      pondered Sam&rsquo;s open-handedness in the blouse-shop, and concluded that the
      Branstones were congenital liars about money.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the future she would know how to act. Sam had plenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you had money up your sleeve all the time,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam winked facetiously. &ldquo;There are a lot of funny things up my sleeve,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m learning that,&rdquo; said Ada. Which he took for a compliment; and
      grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had long since made up his mind that the way with women was to mystify
      them, to treat them like children at a conjuring entertainment, to
      surprise them with results, but never to explain. He nearly choked with
      pride over his exploit with Sir William Gatenby. But for the hat-box and
      the blouses up there on the rack, what he had done was too good to be
      true, and certainly it was too good to be told to a woman. They did not
      understand business; no woman could appreciate the daring spirit of his
      feat.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he told Ada that he had borrowed from Gatenby, she would simply say
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; and treat his unexampled audacity as a matter of course. It was
      inspiration, brilliantly conceived and brilliantly executed, and its
      bright memory was not to be tarnished by a woman&rsquo;s dull acceptance of it
      as something not in the least extraordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grinned and did not tell, and what did not occur to him was that if he
      offered no explanation she would supply one of her own. It is idiotic to
      tell a wife everything, but wise to tell nearly everything; especially
      when it is open to her to draw a false conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam did not think a false conclusion open to her, because he still
      believed the best of Ada, because he was still in love. But falling out of
      love is desperately easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a walled town,&rdquo; says Touchstone, &ldquo;is worthier than a village, so is
      the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
      bachelor,&rdquo; and Sam was married. He could lay that flattering unction to
      his soul, could hold his head higher, because he was a ratepayer and bore
      responsibilities, and went home at night to a house with a garden. He did
      all that, and it was empty honour because success in marriage, as in all
      else, is not to be had ready-made, but depends upon the will to make
      adjustments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The will can come best from passion, and there was no passion here to tide
      them over the awkward age of marriage, the first difficult year when the
      adjustments must, if ever, be made. Granted passion, a man can love a
      woman whom he knows to be a murderess; let passion lack, and he can fall
      out of love because the woman snores or is untidy. Sam&rsquo;s marriage was not
      made in heaven, but by Ada in Heaton Park, and with a marriage so made it
      is as easy to fall out of love as off a house. Little things count more
      than big when there is no passion to create its life-long mirage.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you cannot have the mirage of passion there is a useful substitute
      called common sense, another name for compromise, and Ada refused to
      compromise. She was for self, unmitigated and supreme. Ada left the
      adjustments to Sam, and relaxed in nothing from her perfect selfishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little thing which counted heavily against her, almost at once, was
      simply that Ada was untidy. She did not invent places for things, or, if
      she did, they were never used. She left her clothes downstairs after she
      had been out, and the piano is not the place for a hat or the sofa for an
      umbrella. It annoyed Sam to distraction to find her clothes distributed
      about their bedroom, slung carelessly over chair backs, pitched on the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men are not the untidy sex: the virtue of tidiness, like most others, is
      evenly distributed. Sam was tidy by nature, and habit is stronger still.
      Ada&rsquo;s misfortune was that he was used to Anne, that Anne was neat and Ada
      a slut. Sam did not know until he missed it how much he appreciated Anne&rsquo;s
      tidiness, how much he needed it and how much he hated untidiness until he
      lived with it in Ada. In London, in the hotel, he had excused what he saw
      of it, because it was in an hotel; which was also why there had been
      little to see, by reason of a good chambermaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      At home, it hurt him and he could do nothing. Ada did nothing, either. She
      had not married for love, and one does not change a habit without strong
      motive. His hints appeared to Ada peevish and unreasonable. She thought he
      made mountains out of molehills and despised him for small-mindedness; he
      thought a woman who could not put a petticoat into a drawer when he asked
      her was wilfully provoking him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not wilful of set purpose. She simply refused to disturb her
      habits, to accommodate herself to him, to make a sacrifice to love. She
      had no love to which to sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      And presently he found out that he, too, did not love. But that was all.
      Then and afterwards that was, damnably, all. He did not love, but neither
      did he hate. He had never loved her deeply enough to hate her. That was
      the tragedy of Sam&rsquo;s marriage: indifference, the deadliest sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was indifferent to her, to her untidiness and even to her extravagance.
      She could not treat clothes reasonably, she did not know how to wear them
      when she had them, but she lusted madly to possess them. She was grossly,
      inexcusably extravagant, and he was indifferent. He was indifferent
      because he was growing rich, and wanted his energies for the purpose of
      growing richer, not of quarrelling with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was another tragedy. They never quarrelled. They never cleared the
      air, they never flushed the drain. They did not make adjustments, but left
      things where they were, in a bad place. On honeymoon, they turned from
      looking at each other to look at London, and at home, after one experience
      of revelation, they did not seek another, but rebounded and looked
      anywhere but at themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Peter was looking, and Anne, through the eyes of George, was looking,
      and it seemed to her that things were happening as she had expected they
      would happen. She had said the girl was no good and what George told her
      in his fumbling way gave her to see that the girl turned wife was equally
      no good. Anne tightened her lips grimly and went on with her efficient
      charring. She thought her time would come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked for the coming of love to bless this marriage to which he had
      consented in the belief that his God of love would sanctify. He had
      trusted to the strength of Sam, and to the hope that Sam&rsquo;s strength would
      turn to sweetness; and it only turned to business. It did not lead Ada
      from materialism, but drew Peter himself, unwittingly at first, towards
      it. Peter found himself selecting texts for Sam&rsquo;s &ldquo;Church Child&rsquo;s
      Calendar,&rdquo; a labour of love, which nevertheless had nothing to do with
      Ada, except in the most indirect way, and nothing to do with the Sam and
      Ada situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the fact that, to them, there seemed to be no situation which
      distressed Peter. They simply let things be, and things let be obey the
      law of gravity. He hoped, ardently, for children. Children blessed
      marriage in the physical sense, and from that blessing the other, the
      spiritual blessing, might arise.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was at one time hope that Ada might have a child... and then the
      hope was blighted, and the doctor told them not to hope again. Ada would
      never be a mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could have told them that,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d only to look at the girl
      to see it.&rdquo; Which may only have been wisdom after the event, but certainly
      did not imply that Anne was disappointed; though Peter was, and bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam, too, had wanted a son, but not, as Peter thought, by Ada and for Ada.
      He wanted an heir for dynastic reasons. He was the Branstone Publishing
      Company, its parent and original, and wanted flesh of his flesh to publish
      after him. He dreamed of a young Sam in the cap of the Grammar School, who
      should go to the University to which he had not gone and have the chances
      he had missed. He built many castles in Spain for the son who was never
      born.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ada got up from bed and flashed greedily into new clothes. If the measure
      of her buying was the measure of her grief, she had been deeply touched.
      Perhaps she was touched, for she had aimed at marriage, which is
      incomplete without a child. But in the shops, the fashion papers, her
      clothes and the clothes of other women she found distraction and an
      occupation. She passed a milestone and went on her way. Ada was no stoic,
      no hider of her grief, and since she did not complain she must have
      thought her childlessness was nothing to complain about. When she set her
      heart on marriage, she hadn&rsquo;t, perhaps, looked further than the ring, the
      ceremony and the honourable state of being Mrs. Branstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She plunged to shops and spending money, Sam to business and making it;
      and some, at any rate, of the now thwarted love he had been storing for
      his son passed to the business. Somewhere at the back of his mind he knew
      his business was not lovable; that it was pitch; that one cannot touch
      pitch without being defiled. But neither can one deal successfully in
      pitch without arriving at faith in the virtues of pitch. At intimate
      moments he was aware that the &ldquo;Social Evil&rdquo; pamphlet was pernicious, but
      Sam Branstone, inducing a bookseller to stock it, was more than an
      advocate who believes temporarily in his brief: he was a missionary with
      faith in his mission. So, too, with the texts. He sold them with the
      conviction that it was good for people to have texts on their walls. He
      counterfeited sincerity until he came to be sincere, or, at all events, to
      forget that he was insincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further and further into the unsearched recesses of his mind he pressed
      the thought that he sold texts because their sales were good for him, and
      with his working, everyday, non-introspective mind he had a sincerity
      about his wares, convenient but none the less authentic,-which was
      invaluable both to his self-respect and as a first aid to success in
      salesmanship. He never, in the old days, praised a house with the ringing
      voice of absolute conviction which he used about Law&rsquo;s &ldquo;Serious Call.&rdquo; He
      had not read Law, but the sales hung fire till he became persuaded of
      Law&rsquo;s tremendous worth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a serious call of his own, a call to sell good books at good
      profits, and the call expressed itself in his clothes and his appearance.
      He seemed older, graver, took his frock-coat into daily wear, used only
      black in ties and socks, and had the air of one, who, if not a clergyman,
      was often in their company, though as a fact he was more frequently with
      commercial travellers, and in the hotels at night his repertoire of
      smoke-room stories came no less gaily from his tongue than of old.
    </p>
    <p>
      And about this time his moustache began to droop like a curtain over his
      resolute mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stewart came into the office one day with a parcel under his arm. He had
      seen neither Sam nor his office lately, and stared wide-eyed at both.
      Carter, partner in the printing business, still occupied the dilapidated
      office where Sam had found him, but the Branstone Publishing Company had
      ampler premises next door, in a building which Sam rented as warehouse for
      his stock. Gilt lettering on its windows called the attention of the
      passer-by to the Branstone + Classics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam still looked after detail, and when Stewart came in was correcting
      proofs of a tear-off calendar with a Bible at his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Stewart, &ldquo;that you <i>are</i> Branstone, but why
      disguise yourself as a Scottish Elder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in my usual clothes,&rdquo; said Sam, rather huffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the clothes are the man, this is no place for me. Do you often use the
      Bible in your business hours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He often did, not only to check with a quite beautiful precision the texts
      on his calendars by the Authorised Version, but in another way, and one
      which seemed to show, if it showed anything, that he looked upon the Bible
      with intimate familiarity. Perhaps one mascot was the vellum-bound copy of
      the &ldquo;Social Evil&rdquo; pamphlet and the other the Bible. At any rate, his price
      code used in the office was made up this way:
    </p>
    <h3>
      M Y F A T H E R G O D
    </h3>
    <h3>
      1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20
    </h3>
    <p>
      New clerks initiated into that code used to wonder at it for a day. Then
      they got used to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m correcting the proofs of this calendar,&rdquo; Sam explained. &ldquo;You see,
      it&rsquo;s a shaving calendar. You hang this up by your shaving-mirror and study
      the text for the day while you shave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Stewart. &ldquo;I go to the barber&rsquo;s. My hand&rsquo;s unsteady in the
      morning. But I see the idea. First read the text, then wipe your razor on
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not the idea. See.&rdquo; He pointed to the card of the calendar, and
      read solemnly:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      &ldquo;A text a day
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Drives care away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t drive my sort of care away,&rdquo; said Stewart. &ldquo;Mine&rsquo;s serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can be no trouble too serious for you to find consolation in this
      calendar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose I have toothache on quarter-day, and the consolation you
      offer for that date is consolation to a man who can&rsquo;t pay his rent?
      Seriously, Branstone, am I behind the scenes in this office, or do you
      never drop the showman? I admit you&rsquo;re in the pi-market, and you&rsquo;ve
      dressed the pi-man&rsquo;s part and you&rsquo;ve got his patter, too, but I don&rsquo;t know
      that you need exercise it on me. This stock of yours looks dire,&rdquo; he
      commented, strolling round the office. &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s the stuff that
      sells?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My business,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;is founded on a rock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came in here to sell you a fortune,&rdquo; said Stewart. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to
      talk cant at me, I&rsquo;ll take the fortune to a London publisher. Your
      business may be founded on a rock, but the name of the rock is the &lsquo;Social
      Evil.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The word rock,&rdquo; said Sam, with a twinkle in his eye, &ldquo;is also used for a
      kind of toffee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now that I know you&rsquo;re sane, I&rsquo;ll talk to you. And I&rsquo;ll talk
      toffee, too I didn&rsquo;t think in the days of my earnest youth that I should
      come to this, but you never know what debt will do to a man. I&rsquo;ve written
      a novel. At least, it isn&rsquo;t a novel, it&rsquo;s an outrage on decency. It&rsquo;s a
      violent assault on the emotions. It&rsquo;s the sort of thing I deserve shooting
      for writing. Treacle is bitter compared with it, and it does not contain
      one word of literature. It is a cast-iron certainty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must read it,&rdquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re growing distrustful,&rdquo; said Stewart sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t buy pigs in pokes, even when they&rsquo;re yours,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Come
      along in a couple of days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He read the novel, and was ready for Stewart when he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have taken the liberty,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of marking some passages in this
      manuscript which you may care to alter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh? I know it&rsquo;s mawkish, but I don&rsquo;t believe there is a limit to what
      they&rsquo;ll stand&mdash;and like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I refer particularly to the character you have called Hetaera.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But only once. After that she&rsquo;s called Hetty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hetty,&rdquo; said Sam severely, &ldquo;will have to be cut out. She is an impure
      woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even the most popular of novels should bear some relationship to life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish me to publish this one, Hetty must go. Branstones have a
      reputation to sustain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; said Stewart. &ldquo;Hetty is the one oasis of truth in a desert of
      sloppy sentimentality. She&rsquo;s true because I happen to know her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is nothing to your credit, Stewart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stewart stared. &ldquo;Are you pulling my leg, Sam, or is this really serious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you doubt my seriousness when I ask that fiction should be
      devoid of offence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you mean devoid of truth?&rdquo; He recovered his temper and his
      perspective. After all, he was very short of money. &ldquo;All right, Sam,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Edit me. Censor me. I thought I knew things, but there are deeps
      below the lowest depths, and you have reached them. I surrender. What are
      the terms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam offered terms which were quite generous. He might want Stewart again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The novel was purged of Hetty and published. The three-page prayer of the
      distressed heroine was used, in paraphrase, from quite a number of
      nonconformist pulpits, and the book was a huge success. It was the first
      of that series&mdash;Branstone&rsquo;s Happy Novels for Healthy Homes&mdash;which
      carried the strength of the literary emetic to a point of concentrated
      sweetness undreamt of before, and discovered somewhere a public stomach
      which did not reject its nauseating jam, but revelled in it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI&mdash;THE POLITICAL ANIMAL
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>F only Ada had had
      the courage of what ought to have been her convictions, things would have
      been very different. But she hadn&rsquo;t the pluck or the zest in life to be
      anything at all except an almost perfect negative, and a man will fight
      for a wife for many reasons, but not for the reason that she is a
      full-stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ada, as Peter knew when he consented to the marriage, could be led: with
      even surer hope of good result she could be driven, and if Sam had cared
      to drive, to play Petruchio with Ada, he could have turned her negative
      into a comparative, if not into a positive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unhappily, his driving powers were otherwise engaged, and his objectives
      were on the battlefield, his office, rather than in the dormitory which he
      might have turned into a home. And since Ada had all that she was
      conscious of wanting, she had a dull contentment. Two servants and credit
      at the shops were good enough for Ada, and good enough, too, for Sam,
      because they advertised success. If Ada had been actively vicious, if she
      had drunk, if men or a man had obsessed her, if indeed she had been
      anything that was bad perceptibly, Sam would have abandoned his
      indifference and taken a strong and effective line with her. It might, at
      first, have been only because a positively vicious Ada would have been bad
      for the Branstone + Classics, but it would have ended by being good for
      Ada and for Sam: it would have been the beginning of Ada <i>and</i> Sam,
      of their dual life which had not yet come to birth. But, as it was, he saw
      nothing to fight. There was a superficial rightness; therefore all was
      right, he could forget Ada and turn to the things which were vital to him,
      business for its own sake, and business considered as a stepping-stone to
      politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was content for some time to leave his political ambitions alone,
      because it seemed to him that money, quite a lot of money, was needed for
      politics. In truth, he was rather awed by his ambition: the House of
      Commons seemed a tremendous distance from his office in Manchester, and he
      thought a great deal of money would be needed for the fare. Fundamentally,
      he was modest and rarely overrated his abilities, but he believed that he
      had luck, and thought money a good first aid to more luck. Well as he was
      doing in business, he could not afford to divert his energies from
      moneymaking to politics, wherein he did not mean to begin at the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not ready yet to make political opportunities for himself, but if
      political opportunities came to him, that was another matter. And they did
      come. When he interviewed Sir William Gatenby, he threw a pebble into a
      pool whose wave was to wash him to high places.
    </p>
    <p>
      It washed him into the knowledge of Mr. Charles Wattercouch, who was agent
      for the Division. Wattercouch read Gatenby&rsquo;s letter about Sam with some
      surprise, as one of his recruiting grounds for voluntary workers was the
      Concentrics, and he thought he recalled hearing Sam speak for the other
      faction, but he catalogued the name for future reference on his list of
      earnest young men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wattercouch, like Sam, was in no hurry. He preferred men to come to him,
      not to go in search of them, but Sam did not come, and a letter from
      Gatenby was not to be neglected. Though Gatenby had probably dismissed the
      subject from his mind, he paid half of Wattercouch&rsquo;s salary, and he might
      inquire about Sam some day. So the agent called on Sam at the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a square-built, square-faced man of forty, with a pink, eupeptic
      complexion, and light hair which bristled hardily. Your organizer of
      victory, like your editor, is apt to be cynical about the politics he is
      paid to profess, but Wattercouch kept his perfect faith in Liberalism, in
      spite of the fact that he served the Liberal Party, a feat in the
      accommodation of blameless principle with unscrupulous opportunism, which
      he accomplished with entire sincerity. One can be sincere and Jesuitical,
      in fact one can hardly be Jesuitical without being sincere, and to Mr.
      Wattercouch the most egregiously illiberal acts of the Liberal Party were
      justified because they were the acts of that party, and must, however
      improbable it seemed, be means to the end which was Liberalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not to suggest that Mr. Wattercouch was complex, for he was indeed
      quite simple, as witness the man&rsquo;s relish in his grotesque name. He knew
      the value of being ridiculed when one can turn ridicule into respect, and
      much of his popularity resulted from the genial way in which he took jokes
      about his name. He made an asset of what might, to a less good-natured
      man, have been a handicap. &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; says Ben Jonson, &ldquo;there is a woundy
      luck in names, sir,&rdquo; and Wattercouch turned doubtful luck to good account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam had the gift of the gab, which means that he knew both how and when to
      speak, and how and when to be silent. He was silent while Mr. Wattercouch
      spoke of the valuable work to be done by an earnest labourer in connection
      with the annual revision of the register. The point of the work was to see
      that all possible known Liberals were on the register, and all possible
      objection taken to any known Conservatives, and, complicated as the work
      was by the removal habit amongst electors, it was no light undertaking.
      Certainly no agent could have carried it through without the aid of
      industrious volunteers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sam did not see himself in the character of an industrious volunteer,
      and he was silent for two reasons. The first was that his silence was
      causing Mr. Wattercouch visible embarrassment, and Sam liked the other man
      to be embarrassed; the second was that he was considering how to make Mr.
      Wattercouch see that his suggestion was an absurdity, if not an insult.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled with quite polite superiority. &ldquo;But I think, Mr. Wattercouch,
      that you are making a mistake,&rdquo; he said, as one who apologizes for having
      to be blunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; admitted Wattercouch, &ldquo;I had my doubts, because I fancied I&rsquo;d
      heard you support Stephen Verity at the Concentrics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;is not the mistake to which I allude. I am aware that I
      have supported Verity at the Concentrics. And I am aware that the way to
      learn how to cut a man&rsquo;s hair is to practise on a sheep&rsquo;s head. Verity was
      my sheep&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I hardly follow,&rdquo; said Wattercouch, who was indeed rather
      scandalized by such an allusion to Mr. Verity, who, if a Conservative, was
      an alderman and a noted figure in local politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will make it easier for you by admitting that even I had to learn,&rdquo;
       said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I see. You have now seen the error of your ways. You realize the
      grandeur of Liberalism, the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always did,&rdquo; Sam asserted. &ldquo;When I supported Verity, I was teaching
      myself to speak. I was practising on Toryism that I might become perfect
      in Liberalism. Those days when I made a convenience of Toryism were the
      days of my apprenticeship to the art of speaking. Would you have had me
      speak badly for such a cause as Liberalism? No. But if I spoke badly for
      Toryism, I damaged nothing. Toryism <i>is</i> nothing unless, as I said,
      it is a sheep&rsquo;s head for Liberals to practise on when they are novices,
      and the mistake you made is to suppose that I am still a novice, when, as
      a matter of fact&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He paused elaborately and hoped that Mr.
      Wattercouch would fill in the blank intelligently. &ldquo;But it is premature to
      speak of that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As to the registration, I can send you one of my
      clerks.&rdquo; He made a gesture dismissing as an affair of pygmies that chief
      event of an agent&rsquo;s year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see... I see,&rdquo; said Wattercouch, trying hard to believe that he had so
      far been looking at Sam through the wrong end of a telescope. &ldquo;And you
      yourself, Mr. Branstone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It tempted Sam, that tone of quite startled respect which Wattercouch
      adopted now. The misfortune of Sam&rsquo;s imaginative flights was that he never
      knew when to stop. All that he cared about, at the moment, was to give
      Wattercouch the impression that Sam Branstone was too important to be
      asked to drudge at registration work. He was in no hurry about politics,
      but when he began it would not be as a volunteer clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Two things. One a fact and the other a prophecy. The
      fact is that I am an orator, and the prophecy is that Sir William Gatenby
      will not live long and that I shall take his place as member for the
      Division. Have you a cold?&rdquo; he added, as Wattercouch choked with
      irresistible stupefaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not a cold, neither had he powers of speech just then, and the
      silence grew emphatic without in the least disconcerting Sam. Once
      launched on the sea of bluff, Sam was a hardy navigator, and he had the
      moral support of knowing that his whole purpose just now was to avoid
      being a clerk. To avoid being a clerk it is justifiable to do more than to
      romance: it is justifiable to commit most of the crimes in the Newgate
      Calendar. Sam was hardly asked to do that, but Wattercouch&rsquo;s cough was a
      challenge, and a bluff half bluffed is worse than no bluff at all. It
      became a matter of pride to convince this unbeliever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intend,&rdquo; said Sam with aplomb, &ldquo;to do a good deal of platform for the
      Party. If an election comes soon, so much the better. I shall take the
      opportunity to make myself more popular with the electors than Sir William
      Gatenby is. That is easy. He quotes Latin in election speeches, and I&rsquo;m a
      man of the people. After that, I expect to contest a by-election for a
      seat which the Party regards as a forlorn hope. If it is possible to win
      that seat for our Great Cause, I shall win it. If not, I shall trust to
      two things, the senile decay of Sir William Gatenby and the discretion of
      the Whip&rsquo;s office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wattercouch was adapting himself painfully to the new perspective. He
      granted that Sam had plausibility, and an assurance which nearly lent
      conviction to his astonishing statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in touch with the Whips!&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam remembered and varied an old formula. &ldquo;Do you suppose,&rdquo; he asked
      indignantly, &ldquo;that I should be speaking to you like this if I were not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wattercouch did not suppose it. For one thing he was acquainted with the
      devious ways of Whips, and nothing that those secretive autocrats did
      could surprise him: for another, he wished to believe what Sam wished him
      to believe. He saw in Sam the way out of a dilemma.
    </p>
    <p>
      His dilemma was a common one. A death had caused a vacancy in the Town
      Council, and the local Liberal caucus was almost pathetically embarrassed
      as to its choice of a candidate. There were at least three veteran workers
      for the Cause who expected, with justice, to be approached and none of the
      three could be selected without offence being given to interests which it
      was impolitic to offend.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all very well for the caucus: they left it to Wattercouch, the
      general handy man, to make suggestions, and as he listened to Sam he
      thought he had found a candidate who, simply because he was politically
      unknown, could offend nobody. If the obvious men were wrong, he must rely
      on the rightness of the unexpected, and, after all, Sam might be speaking
      the truth. One never knew where one was with Whips, and here was his
      chance to propitiate Sam and at the same time to solve the problem which
      troubled the caucus. Sam was a dark horse and he wished he knew more about
      him; it was startling to come in search of a voluntary clerk and to find a
      candidate; but, finally, he saw it as a legitimate case for taking a risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; he said, with a very pretty respect in his voice,
      &ldquo;whether municipal politics will appeal to a man of your calibre, but
      there is a vacancy in St. Mary&rsquo;s Ward, and I hardly think there will be
      any difficulty about your adoption as candidate if you cared to stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam pretended to reflect. The truth was that the prospect of an immediate
      seat in the Council made his heart beat fiercely. He had meant for a while
      longer to put business before politics, but this sort of politics was
      business. The Council took up one&rsquo;s time, but conferred a prestige on
      Branstone and the Branstone Publications which would more than compensate
      for the waste of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was deliciously unexpected. He had not studied to impress
      Wattercouch, but had talked exaltedly simply to excuse himself from the
      unseen, thankless drudgery of organization: yet it seemed he had
      impressed. Virtually, he was offered a seat, He was, this soon, to sit
      where Travers had sat, to be a City Father before he was thirty-five. He
      had romanced glibly about a bird in the bush, and found himself grasping a
      bird in hand, and no contemptible fowl either.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must despise nothing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which makes for Liberalism.&rdquo;
       Wattercouch nodded with enthusiasm. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Sam went on, &ldquo;strictly
      between ourselves, the Council is small beer. But it is for the Cause, and
      if I were asked to stand, you may take it that I should not allow the
      larger view I have of my ultimate activities to interfere with my
      acceptance. I take pleasure in duty and I see it as my duty, even if it
      involves the postponement of my Parliamentary ambitions, to throw myself
      wholeheartedly into this conflict.&rdquo; He was wonderfully pious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wattercouch was less emotional. He had heard too many speeches from
      prospective candidates to be carried away by Sam&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Quite probably there
      will be no contest,&rdquo; he said dryly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a safe Liberal seat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have preferred a fight,&rdquo; Sam lied wistfully. &ldquo;But I put duty
      first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a fact, there was no contest, and if each of the three veteran workers
      thought himself aggrieved, he had the consolation of knowing that the
      other two shared his grievance. Wattercouch was discreetly mysterious
      about Sam in the inner councils of the local Party, used Gatenby&rsquo;s name
      freely and managed to convey that Branstone was something much bigger than
      he appeared to be. He had, at least, got them out of their quandary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did Sam discredit his sponsor either at the private meeting he
      addressed or at the public one which followed. He had said he was an
      orator, Wattercouch had repeated it indefatigably, and Sam&rsquo;s audience
      believed it implicitly. He was not quite an orator, but was coming along
      nicely under the tuition of an old actor who had failed on the stage and
      now called himself a professor of elocution.
    </p>
    <p>
      He became Mr. Councillor Branstone, and happy little references to the
      event began to appear in the papers. The <i>Sunday Judge</i>, for
      instance, had &ldquo;no doubt that Mr. Branstone will live to look back upon his
      unopposed return to the Council as a minor episode of his political
      career, and we speak by the book. Branstone will go far, but, meantime, it
      is something even for him to know that he is the most popular man in St.
      Mary&rsquo;s Ward. We had almost written in the whole city, but that would be to
      anticipate. How is it done? How is such popularity achieved? How, in other
      words, did merit become recognized? Mr. Branstone himself only smiled when
      we asked him, but his smile is half of his secret and his rousing, earnest
      oratory the other half. They are indeed an open smile and an open secret.
      But there are other secrets less open. All we shall say now is, &lsquo;Watch
      Branstone. He will not disappoint you.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a low evening paper, run in the Conservative interest, which
      fastened on the phrase &ldquo;other secrets less open&rdquo; and published the
      scurrilous statement that one of the less open secrets was the fact that
      Mr. Councillor Branstone&rsquo;s mother was a charwoman, but the paragraph
      appeared only in the early edition and unaccountably disappeared from
      later issues. It did no harm, as first editions are not published for
      politicians, but for sportsmen, and, in any case, there was a brief, but
      dignified, eulogy of Mr. Branstone in the <i>Manchester Warden</i> next
      day. That paper happened, fortunately, to be Liberal in politics, and
      indeed to be, on just occasion, a valiant log-roller. It rolled a log for
      Sam; the popularity of Branstone was established, hall-marked by the
      Press; and it was about this time that Stewart&rsquo;s second potboiler was
      accepted for inclusion in Branstone&rsquo;s Novels. The terms were even more
      favourable to the author than before.

      CHAPTER XVII&mdash;THE VERITY AFFAIR
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE curse of the
      Wandering Jew is upon the advertiser: he must move perpetually. Not that
      Sam would have been in any case content to sit idly on a seat in the
      Council Chamber. He hadn&rsquo;t the sedentary gifts, nor was he of the breed of
      Ada, who, the state of matrimony once achieved, existed in contemplation
      of a glory which was even more vegetable than animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to do something to justify a paper reputation for popularity and he
      had even to convince himself that he would not soon wake up to find it all
      a dream. It had happened too easily to be true, or, at least, safe.
      Wattercouch had hinted that things were expected of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were, of course, expected of him as a Liberal, and Sam was not, in
      fact, a Liberal but a Conservative. A Conservative is a man who conserves,
      who says &ldquo;Aye&rdquo; to the words of Giovanni Malatesta.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;What I have snared, in that I set my teeth
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      And lose with agony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam had snared, he proposed to go on snaring and never to lose what he had
      snared. Whereas a Liberal is a Conservative weakened by sentimental
      compassion for the dispossessed. He is not the opposite of a Conservative,
      but a Conservative who is weak-minded, or timid or scrupulous enough to
      think himself a robber and to propose to give the poor some five per cent
      of his plunder. The opposite of a Conservative is an anarchist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Politically he was a Liberal because he thought the Liberals certain to
      come in for a long innings at the next election, and if there was any
      feeling about it at all (beyond a desire to be on the winning side), it
      was for the pudgy orator whose tremendous sentences had caught his
      imagination when he visited the House of Commons.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he did became known as the Verity affair. It might with equal and
      perhaps superior justice have been called the Branstone affair but for
      that malicious impulse which causes people to refer to a scandal by the
      name of the exposed rather than the exposer. It is like the odium which we
      attach to a man who has been in prison, where he had already had his
      punishment. Mankind is resolute against letting sleeping dogs lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Alderman Verity was an elder statesman of the Council and a
      Conservative of the honest, unyielding type who thought that to approve of
      Tory Democracy was to be either a rogue or a fool, and Sam objected to him
      not because he was a Conservative, but for deeper reasons. Verity was the
      landlord of Sam&rsquo;s offices. Every tenant objects to every landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      One calls Verity an honest Conservative because he made no concessions,
      not because he was himself a fount of honour. He had no sympathy with the
      modern mawkishness about pampering the people. He admitted that one had to
      make promises, that the way to win elections was to tickle the elector as
      if he were a trout, but as an Alderman he sat above the cockpit of
      electioneering and frowned upon the Liberal attitudes to which younger
      Conservatives descended to catch a vote. And their view that the Council
      existed for the people honestly revolted him: it was so patently the other
      way about.
    </p>
    <p>
      The particular instance was Baths in Hulme. He saw no sense in Baths in
      Hulme. He was quite sincere in his belief that to build Baths in Hulme was
      to cast pearls before swine. Hulme had not asked for Baths and did not
      want Baths. Baths were opportunities for cleanliness and Hulme did not
      want to be clean. Hulme would not be Hulme if it were clean.
    </p>
    <p>
      The uncleanliness of Hulme was an institution. Conservatives conserve
      institutions, and the only thing which could remove his Conservative and
      Aldermanic objection to Baths in Hulme was self-interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Self-interest is the greatest institution of them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued to oppose the young bloods of his Party because for a long
      time he did not see where his self-interest came in. He even opposed them
      publicly. He said in public that Baths in Hulme were a nasty, pandering,
      Liberal idea and that no decent-minded Conservative could think of it
      without nausea. And then, suddenly and silently, he was found to be with
      those who proposed that Hulme should bathe if it wanted to. His change of
      mind coincided with the discovery that there was no open space in Hulme
      where Baths could be erected. Something would have to come down that the
      Baths might go up, and what would come down, and why, was the secret of
      Mr. Alderman Verity and one or two others of the Old Gang who had the
      habit of standing loyally by each other when a little simple jobbery was
      in question. Really, it was too simple to be reprehensible. If a Town
      Council can by one and the same resolution clear away a slum, and confer
      Baths, who benefits, and doubly, but the Town? Naturally, the slum owner
      has to be compensated, though adequate compensation can hardly be put high
      enough. Slums are so profitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wattercouch had many preoccupations just now, but his vigilance was a
      habit, and he was struck by the change in Mr. Alderman Verity&rsquo;s attitude.
      The silence which succeeded his eloquence seemed pregnant with something,
      and Wattercouch wondered with what. It was an error of judgment in the
      Alderman not to be ill at this time, but he had covered his tracks and the
      affair was prejudged, settled before it ever came before the Council.
      Verity had neither conscience nor fears about it, and the Conservative
      Party, with a prescient eye on the imminent General Election, was going to
      use its majority in the Council that it might figure as the Party which
      bestowed cleanliness on Hulme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wattercouch wondered why it was Simpson&rsquo;s Buildings which those
      benefactors of mankind proposed to buy and demolish so as to clear a site
      for their Baths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This might be your opportunity, Branstone,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it asking a good deal of the junior member of the Council to
      suggest that he tackle an old hand like Alderman Verity?&rdquo; asked Sam,
      leaning back in his chair with his thumbs in his waistcoat armholes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We all expect great things of you,&rdquo; flattered Wattercouch, who had still
      to justify his selection of Sam to the Liberal caucus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to fail you, either. But I can&rsquo;t oppose these Baths. As a
      Liberal I am in favour of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So are we all. But we are not in favour of Alderman Verity&rsquo;s being in
      favour of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s David and Goliath to pit me against Verity, Wattercouch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;David won.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Samuel will win. But he will make a condition. The condition is a
      free hand. I want no help and no advice and I undertake on that condition
      to pulverize Verity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll tell me what you propose to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said a free hand, Wattercouch. Leave this to me and I&rsquo;ll settle it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Wattercouch that every time he had dealings with Sam he was
      asked to take a gambling chance, but he had no plan of action, and the man
      without a plan is always at a disadvantage against the man who, with or
      without a plan, looks confident. He left it to Sam and there was, as it
      happened, nobody to whom he could have left it better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wattercouch had no inside information and only vague suspicions that
      Verity&rsquo;s change of mind was rooted in the same earth as Verity&rsquo;s
      self-interest. But Sam knew something and was not boasting idly when he
      undertook to &ldquo;pulverize&rdquo; Verity.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he knew, rightly used at the right moment, was dynamic enough, but he
      lacked evidence and he did not see how to get evidence. The Council
      meeting was at hand and he was finding it each day more difficult to grin
      with cheerful assurance at the mutely questioning Wattercouch. He felt
      distinctly unassured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The facts were clear enough to him. Verity now approved of the Baths
      because they were to be erected on the site of Simpson&rsquo;s Buildings, and
      Verity owned that dilapidated pile. He did not own it publicly because
      respectable aldermen do not own slum property; he owned it in the name of
      Mr. Sylvester Lamputt, Verity&rsquo;s second cousin, a man of straw; and Sam
      knew that he owned it because he had a good memory, he remembered a
      conversation between Lamputt and Mr. Travers, which he had overheard, and
      all the present circumstances pointed to the relations of Lamputt with
      Verity being as they had been when Sam was in the estate agent&rsquo;s office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verity was aware that retail profits are higher than wholesale, and small
      retail than large retail; that when, for instance, a poor woman buys an
      ounce of tea she pays a higher rate for it than when a rich woman buys a
      pound or ten pounds, and similarly that when a family rents a room in a
      slum property it pays immensely more for it proportionately than when a
      cotton king rents a warehouse in the centre of the city. But it is
      dignified to let a warehouse to a cotton king, and disreputable to let
      single rooms in Hulme, so second cousin Lamputt was the putative owner of
      Simpson&rsquo;s Buildings. Sam smiled at the ludicrous thought of the burly
      alderman sheltering behind the shrivelled form of his second cousin
      Lamputt. It was like trying to hide a bull behind a weasel.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not smile often in those days. He paid a visit, at dusk, to
      Simpson&rsquo;s Buildings, and breathed softly lest Simpson&rsquo;s Buildings should
      collapse upon him. Obviously, the alderman was finding his market in the
      nick of time. It eliminated doubt, but did not provide proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that in the matter of Simpson&rsquo;s Buildings, Lamputt was identical
      with Verity, but he wanted evidence, and to get evidence he must rely upon
      the dullness of Mr. Lamputt, and did not think that he was dull. The totem
      of Lamputt was certainly a ferret, and Sam credited the ferret tribe with
      nimble wit. He had to be more nimble, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rejected the idea of making Mr. Lamputt gloriously drunk because it
      seemed impossible to associate glory, even the glory of intoxication, with
      Mr. Lamputt&rsquo;s feeble body. It was a case, as usual with Sam, of taking
      chances.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did nothing at all until the morning of the meeting which was to decide
      if Hulme might bathe, and, even then, left his office only a little before
      his usual time for going to the Town Hall. He turned into a back street,
      ran up many stairs to the attic office whose door bore the name of
      Sylvester Lamputt, Agent (more sins are committed in the name of agency
      than of charity), and flung panting into the single room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He won the first throw in his game. Sylvester was in.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat on a high office stool writing on the malodorous page of an
      enormous ledger, looking for all the world like a diminutive office boy on
      whom some one has fitted, in cruel jest, a hoary head. If the calendars on
      his walls were trustworthy witnesses, he was agent for half the insurance
      companies in the British Isles. Autolycus was Sylvester&rsquo;s other name.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reverenced his ledger as other men reverence the Bible. He kept no
      other diary, for the ledger was his book of life, and when Sam burst upon
      him he was absorbed in his records. He closed the book mechanically
      through pure secretive habit, and closed into it just enough of his wits
      to put him at a disadvantage with Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam gave no quarter. &ldquo;Mr. Verity,&rdquo; he gasped before he was fairly in the
      room. &ldquo;Simpson&rsquo;s Buildings... the title-deeds... here, or has Mr. Verity
      got them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It succeeded. Lamputt took him for an urgent special messenger from
      Verity. &ldquo;If Mr. Verity&rsquo;s memory is going,&rdquo; he said with dignity, &ldquo;mine is
      not. The title-deeds are in the third drawer of his safe in his office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his name?&rdquo; asked Sam quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Lamputt, and then, too late, became suspicious. &ldquo;I say,&rdquo;
       he began, &ldquo;what&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Sam had gone, and though Mr. Lamputt reached his hat and the door in
      one bound and careered down his familiar stairs like the office boy his
      figure aped, Sam had turned a corner and was lost to sight. Lamputt raced
      to Verity&rsquo;s office, only to find that the alderman was then attending a
      Council meeting. Lamputt could do no more, indeed for a man with a weak
      heart he had already done too much: but he had a strong foreknowledge of
      the wrath of Alderman Verity, and goes, an unhappy, shrinking figure, out
      of this story to an unknown fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam went to the Town Hall with his bomb-shell, and they disapprove of
      bombs at Council meetings, so he was sedulous to spare their feelings. He
      supported that part of the resolution which referred to the erection of
      Baths, but proposed that it should stand alone and that the naming of a
      site should be deferred. Curiously, his proposal made the Conservative
      majority very angry: the resolution was one and indivisible. Sam regretted
      that in order to vote against the misuse of a particular site, he was
      forced to vote against the Baths, but standing as he did for purity in
      civic life, detesting the very shadow of jobbery, he had no alternative
      but to move that the resolution be rejected. Here was a proposal which,
      however innocent its wording, did in fact imply that ratepayers&rsquo; money was
      to be handed over to a prominent member of the party opposite, to a
      gentleman in whose safe, at whose office, in the third drawer of the safe,
      were deposited at that moment the title-deeds of the property whose
      acquisition by the city was suggested. He abhorred personalities, he
      shrank from mentioning a name, and if the second part of the resolution
      were withdrawn, he&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too much for a young, impetuous innocent opposite. &ldquo;You dare not
      mention a name. You lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam hoped the Council would absolve him of causing a scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prove your words,&rdquo; cried the rash gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suggest,&rdquo; said Sam blandly, &ldquo;that we avoid unpleasantness. I have made
      a statement and I am asked to prove it. If a deputation of three will go
      with me and Mr. Alderman Verity to his office, the title-deeds of
      Simpson&rsquo;s Buildings will be found in the place I have indicated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the sort of drama which appealed more to the readers of the evening
      papers than to the Council. Mr. Mayor, in the chair, was speechless in
      embarrassed distress. Sam had the calm of imperishable rock in wind-tossed
      surf. In the midst of a breathless excitement, Mr. Alderman Verity was
      seen to totter to his feet. &ldquo;I own the property,&rdquo; he said, collapsed into
      his seat and graced that seat no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Impossible even for a Conservative paper to uphold Verity, impossible to
      do more than to suggest that Sam&rsquo;s manners were deplorable: while his own
      papers made a hero of him, found his manners a model of consideration and
      his triumph as graceful as it was complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Sam cared to know was that he was on the crest of a wave of popularity
      and a general election was at hand. Night after night he spoke, and the
      tritest platitudes, with Sam&rsquo;s smile behind them, shone like new-found
      truth. He was <i>persona gratissima</i> before he opened his mouth: it
      gave him confidence, and confidence is half the speaker&rsquo;s battle. He
      coined some of those ugly, smart, journal-easy catch-words which help to
      win elections, and are quoted in the papers and blossom on the placards.
      And, with it all, he became what he had prematurely called himself, an
      orator.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had the satisfaction of watching audiences sit through the boredom of
      Gatenby that they might hear Branstone, and of being himself the &ldquo;star&rdquo;
       speaker at outlying meetings. Gatenby was returned by a record majority
      and it was Bran-stone for whom the mob yelled outside the Town Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The election was an early one, and Sam was called to speak in other
      constituencies. He had wires, not only from agents in quite distant
      divisions, but actually from Headquarters. He was in touch with the Whips!
      Less than a year after he had lied to Wattercouch, the lie turned true. He
      was in touch with the Whips, a wanted speaker, a man of reputation, a name
      to be applauded when it was announced on a platform, for all the world
      like people applaud when the number of a star performer goes up on the
      announcement board of a music-hall. He was not of the Great Unwanted, but
      of the few who were wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone discovered at this time the old canard which had once appeared in
      the first edition of an evening paper, that his mother was a charwoman. He
      did not deny it, but used it as Wattercouch his name, making an asset of a
      handicap. He was of the people, blood of their blood, a democrat by birth,
      knowing their aspirations and their needs because he, too, had needed and
      aspired. In the heat of that election he became egregiously a Radical. It
      told, it &ldquo;went&rdquo; with the audiences: that was the thing that mattered to
      Sam. He hadn&rsquo;t so much as the shadow of a principle, he was winning, on
      the winning side, and pleased himself enormously.
    </p>
    <p>
      And by the end of the campaign he stood, actually, where he had aimed to
      stand: amongst prospective candidates who fight, as it were, probationary
      elections where, they have scarcely a sporting chance, to pay their
      footing towards the sort of candidature which gives a man his seat. If the
      Conservatives had offered him a tolerably safe seat, without preliminary
      fight, he would have ratted eagerly, and the charwoman his mother would
      have been pressed into service on the other side. It was all one to Sam
      Branstone.

      CHAPTER XVIII&mdash;WHEN EFFIE CAME
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HEN Effie came
      with beauty, shattering the life he lived as sunshine breaks the April
      clouds. At first he did not know what had happened to him: there was a
      radiance, but he thought it nothing greater than her physical appeal. He
      was disturbed, moved as nothing had moved him before&mdash;not even
      applause&mdash;but did not see that more had come to him than loveliness
      where all had been unlovely. He did not realize that there were greater
      things in Effie than her comeliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the daughter of a doctor who had lived up to every penny of his
      income and died leaving his widow nothing but a cottage in the country,
      which had been their week-end haunt. The widow sold the practice and got
      for it enough to keep herself, with care, in the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      There Mrs. Mannering lived unhappily, resentfully, nourishing a grudge
      against her poverty, developing a vein of hardy thrift unseen till now.
      With management, she had enough, but lacked the gift of management. She
      did not see things in proportion, imagined herself deep sunk in poverty
      and made unreasoning demands on Effie. On Effie, not on her son who
      managed a rubber plantation at Penang and followed the spendthrift habits
      of his father. Father and son, the Mannerings were cursed with a passion
      for popularity and entertained with open house to all comers. In the East,
      it cost Rex Mannering more than it had cost his father at home and,
      granted his habits, he was right in saying that he could do nothing for
      his mother. He could deny himself nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It left the more for Effie. She who was not trained to work must go into
      the world and fight not only for her bread but for her mother&rsquo;s luxuries.
      Augusta Mannering was merciless in her demands. She believed, quite
      sincerely, that Eflie was gaining riches in the offices of Manchester and
      withholding a share from her in simple self-indulgence. Was it not by
      going to offices that Dr. Mannering&rsquo;s rich patients had been able to pay
      their bills? And hadn&rsquo;t they an army of friends who used to eat their
      salt?
    </p>
    <p>
      But the friends, misunderstanding Effie&rsquo;s pride, offered no help of the
      kind she could accept. She wanted work, not invitations to houses where,
      with dress and servants&rsquo; tips, it would cost her more to live than in the
      rooms she found in Rusholme. She had not the means to be decorative now,
      and it occurred to nobody that Effie was a clerk, wanting a clerk&rsquo;s place.
      They could not think of her, that brilliant girl, shackled to a
      typewriter. They did not offer what she wanted and she was too proud to
      ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then memories are short, especially of the popular men who buy their
      popularity across the dining-table and charge high fees to the unwell to
      procure high feeding for the well; and when the Mannerings disappeared,
      Augusta to her cottage and Effie to Rusholme, there were few inquiries
      made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some other entertainer stepped into the breach of local hospitality;
      Effie&rsquo;s net-play became a legend on their tennis lawns; and she herself
      was deemed to be with her mother in the country, shining on other courts
      than theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not pure callousness, but things are as they are, and one cannot
      live by money and then lose money without losing more than money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie went into the city unfriended and alone, and her mother lived, a
      miser, in her cottage. She wrote to Effie that she needed this and that;
      that Effie must spare of her abundance or her mother must starve, and
      Effie out of her thirty shillings a week did send, but her mother did not
      buy. She warmed her hands at a bank-book, wore ancient clothes and watched
      her credit grow. It was more than a perversion of her old extravagance, it
      was insanity and Effie knew it. To keep an insane woman moderately happy,
      she sacrificed necessities. That is why she was shabby when she came into
      Mr. Branstone&rsquo;s office for the post of typist one bright, revealing
      afternoon soon after his party had triumphed at the polls and he had made
      himself a figure on the hustings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie had found companionship in Rusholme, and knew by now the difference
      between the friendship which is given and the friendship which is bought.
      She had become expert in friendship, and Sam, from their first encounter,
      seemed to her more like a friend than an employer. By then, she had
      experience of employers. That was why she was out of work.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn&rsquo;t, of course, the normal Sam she met, but a Sam exalted, genuinely
      raised and not merely puffed up, by his electioneering notoriety. He had a
      new self-confidence; it seemed to him that little was beyond his reach,
      that he might even hope to come to terms with Effie. Not, that is to say,
      to such terms as her last employer had proposed. Sam was not, in these
      matters, the average sensual man. The point was, and it was to his credit,
      that he discerned something fine in Effie even at this stage, and the mood
      of confidence gave him to hope that he might not seem commonplace to her.
      Already, that afternoon, he cared so much. Her opinion mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      It mattered so greatly that he went slowly about the business of
      surprising her: for that, of course, was what he thought he had to do. She
      might not know things about Branstone which it was good for her to know.
      He might be any employer who advertised for a typist, and he was not any
      employer. He was Branstone, of the Classics and the Novels; town
      councillor; politician; and she must be told about him. She must learn
      what manner of man he was. He wanted to tell her how much greater he was
      going to be, but decided that could wait. First she must know what he had
      done, before it came to telling her what he was going to do, and his
      record would come better from others than from himself. In the office they
      knew it all and, even if she asked no questions, there was much which the
      routine work would tell her of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He curbed impatience and left her for some weeks in the general office,
      where it was supposed that she was picking up some knowledge of the
      business before beginning to act as his secretary, but what he hoped she
      was picking up was some knowledge of him. He had the idea that he was
      popular with his staff, and did not think that they would libel him to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the time he burned to have her sitting with him in the private office.
      It was for that purpose that he had advertised for a typist-secretary, and
      to bring her from the general office could excite no comment. On the
      contrary, to leave her there so long might look strange or at least
      suggest that Effie was a failure. A failure! Much he cared whether she was
      efficient at her work. Yet she was splendidly efficient, and still he
      coquetted with his purpose of having her with him. It seemed to him that
      to call her in would be a step definite and irrevocable, one which he
      wanted and even yearned to make, but about which he hesitated sensuously
      as a bridegroom might hesitate on the threshold of the bridal chamber. He
      neglected to make two certainly profitable journeys to London at this time
      because he could not deny himself the pleasure of seeing her neck as she
      bent over her typewriter when he passed through the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he had hardly spoken to her! But his dreams were vibrant with the
      music of her voice, swelling like an organ till it filled his life with
      new harmony. It filled his life not because he refused to think of Ada,
      but because he could not think of her. Ada wasn&rsquo;t there; she didn&rsquo;t exist.
      She never had been there, for Sam, in the true sense, so that the step
      from the custom which is nothingness to complete nothingness was almost
      imperceptible. She was a ghost from the past fading in the radiance of the
      present. The sun puts out the candlelight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was seeing Effie, of course, with quite grotesquely unperceiving eyes.
      She might have been, for all he saw of her, the beautiful doll she
      emphatically was not. Her outside pleased and satisfied his eye, and he
      took it for granted that the woman within would satisfy him in the same
      way as the woman without. And so, in the long run, she did, but not till
      Sam had made a hurdle race of it and come some awkward croppers on the
      course. The harmony of his organ dream might have been true prophecy; it
      certainly was not present fact. He wasn&rsquo;t seeing himself as Effie saw him,
      or the sidelong glances he cast at her pretty neck might have expressed
      more desire to break than to kiss it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to her a jolly monster, quite lovable if trained, but at present
      as untrained as a badly brought-up dog, and perhaps too old to learn. But
      it might be amusing to see if he could learn, and from her who was not
      used to breaking in a mastiff. That made the thing worth while, his
      bigness and the lovableness she recognized behind the rankness of him.
      Chance might not come her way, and she thought it unlikely that it would,
      but if it did, she meant to take it with both hands. Effie, aged
      twenty-six, proposed to herself to form Sam Bran-stone, who was
      thirty-five and her employer! She smiled at her preposterous audacity, but
      the more she saw and the more she heard of him, the more determination bit
      into her. Droll, officious, absurd&mdash;all these her idea was, and she
      liked it because it was fantastic and because Sam was Sam. In Effie&rsquo;s
      wise, impertinent eyes fantasy and Sam seemed bound together. And yet he
      paid her wages; he was a solid man, a member of the Council, and a serious
      politician! She was impertinent indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he could not, either for his sake or hers, keep her for ever on the
      threshold. For all his late-won confidence he was quite pitiably nervous,
      and held back for days in pure hesitation before the simple action of
      calling her into his office. He thought of it as initiation, a ritual to
      which a high solemnity attached. He intended to act up to its solemnity,
      to usher her into that office with all that was most impressive, to
      signify to her the importance of being secretary to Branstone; and,
      instead, he who was wordy fumbled for words, he who was painfully correct
      dropped two aitches in a sentence, and stood there most comically aghast
      at his slip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, the ritual was finished; one cannot be ritualistic and
      conscious of aitchlessness. Ritual implies the superhuman, the something,
      at least, which sets the executant above the common clay, and to drop an
      aitch is human. In the moment of solemnity, in the mouth of the ritualist,
      it is drolly human. We find incongruity amusing, and the more solemn the
      occasion the more readily does an impish mirth intrude on light pretext.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie giggled. She did not mean to be unkind, but the spectacle of his
      confusion was too much for her. She hadn&rsquo;t the strength to resist, and
      though she turned her giggle, quite neatly, into a cough, it was not
      before he had seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was his great moment, to which he had looked forward, and she giggled
      at him! He felt himself writ down an ass, and wondered for the fraction of
      a second whether he would get more satisfaction from smacking her or from
      kicking himself. Then he saw her looking at him, and nothing seemed to
      matter. He dropped aitches and she giggled. Very well, then he wasn&rsquo;t a
      superman, and she wasn&rsquo;t divine. They were human beings, at this moment in
      the relationship of employer and employed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In future, you will sit at the little desk in here, Miss Mannering.&rdquo; He
      met her eye defiantly as he spoke the &ldquo;here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have your notebook you can take this letter down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was running away from his ruined situation. To dictate a letter to her
      had not been in the scheme at all, as he had planned it. It was a refuge,
      and a safe one, but as he dictated he saw in the letter his opportunity to
      indicate to her that he forgave the giggle. He was writing to an author
      about a manuscript, which he intended to publish, but broke off before he
      reached that decisive point of his letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a bit,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Here is the novel I am writing about. I want your
      opinion of it to fortify my own before I do anything definite. Will you
      have a look at it in here? I&rsquo;m due at a Council meeting and must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Mr. Branstone,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but my judgment isn&rsquo;t very
      reliable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know that until you try,&rdquo; he said, escaping from his office to
      the Town Hall, where he kicked his heels for an hour till the meeting
      began Nor did he return to business that day. He had a shyness and a
      feeling of deflation. He needed time before he could expand again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie took her reading of the novel conscientiously rather than seriously,
      not supposing that her verdict either way would go for anything, but
      appreciating his hint of confidence, and the fact that, considered as
      work, novel-reading was pleasant. And not finishing the manuscript at the
      office, she took it home with her to Rusholme.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Rusholme the landladies are a little humanized from their primitive
      Grundyism, partly by the girl clerk, but mainly because few of them have
      avoided, at one time or another, the theatrical lodger, a valiant tilter
      at conventionalities; and it is possible for a woman in lodgings to be
      called upon by a man in the evening without being evicted as a sinner. One
      must, of course, choose one&rsquo;s landlady with discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie, who had not had the opportunity of selecting her parents and had
      suffered accordingly, chose her landlady with discretion. By now she had
      her friends, those she had made in Manchester, not those she inherited
      from her father; there were men amongst them, and they came to see her.
      Often, in fact, and especially on Sundays, her room was over-crowded; but
      a bed, in the semi disguise of a travelling rug, holds many callers, and
      they solved the problem of hospitality by bringing each a contribution to
      the feast.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-night she had one caller, Stewart, who, having been brought one Sunday
      by a man who knew a woman who was a fellow-clerk with Effie at her
      last-but-one place, had formed the habit of coming as often as he could.
      He was not at the <i>Warden</i> office that night, for the same reason
      which accounted for his not knowing that she had gone to Branstone&rsquo;s. He
      was convalescent after influenza, too limp to write the super-journalism
      of the <i>Warden</i>, well enough to come out to take the tonic called
      Effie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought not to let you in to-night,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Thank Heaven for that,&rdquo;
       he said, coming in. &ldquo;Doing what one ought is the dullest thing I know&mdash;unless
      you&rsquo;re really serious, Effie? In which case I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo; His hand was on the
      door-knob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really serious,&rdquo; she said with mock impressiveness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m working
      overtime. Behold!&rdquo; She threw herself on the bed with the manuscript in
      hand. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; she announced, &ldquo;is Work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can believe it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because that looks like the typescript of a
      novel. If it were mine it would be a pleasure to read; but as it is not
      mine, it is probably work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s work all right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Hard labour, too. I&rsquo;m reading it by
      order of my new chief. He publishes things like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stewart sat up. &ldquo;Not Branstone?&rdquo; he, said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;ve gone to
      Sammy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Do you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know him? I invented him. Bit of a Frankenstein for all that. Better say
      I know most of him. He can still spring surprises on me, and you in his
      office are one of&rsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Don&rsquo;t you like his office?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an office. So long as you&rsquo;ve to be in an office, you could pick
      worse&mdash;easily. Sammy&rsquo;s a stream with a lot of shallows in him, but
      there are also depths, and I&rsquo;ve never fathomed them. There&rsquo;s mud in him,
      but it&rsquo;s not the nasty sort of mud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen that much,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Polluted but curable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not by any chance thinking of yourself as a Branstone River
      Conservancy, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather like him, Dubby,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord! You and Sam: I say, old thing, no offence, but you know he&rsquo;s
      married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Ellie. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s she like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen her since I was his best man. Wasn&rsquo;t tempted to see more of
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as bad as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, rather worse, I believe. Pitch that novel over. I&rsquo;ll tell you in five
      minutes if it&rsquo;s any use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five minutes isn&rsquo;t very fair to the author,&rdquo; she protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, quite. I&rsquo;m a reviewer, and reviewing&rsquo;s badly paid. It teaches you to
      rip the guts out of a novel quickly. Smoke that cigarette and I&rsquo;ll tell
      you all about it by the time you&rsquo;re through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fluttered the pages while she smoked. &ldquo;Utter,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;Utter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t finished it,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but so far I agree with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll agree with me to the end. Pluperfect trash. Sam will love it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see. It&rsquo;s just his line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you trying to prejudice me against him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to save you the trouble of reading the beastly
      thing. I&rsquo;ve given you expert opinion. It&rsquo;s trash and the brand of trash
      that he likes. Didn&rsquo;t I tell you there, was mud in Sam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me you invented him. I don&rsquo;t believe your influence has been for
      good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be hard on a fellow, Effie; I only introduced him to the mud. I
      didn&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;d wallow. Anyhow, let&rsquo;s talk of something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you do influence people, Dubby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m paid for. I&rsquo;m a journalist. Have you never
      heard of the power of the Press? It means a lot of little journalists like
      me writing as their editors tell &lsquo;em to. But I don&rsquo;t appear to have much
      influence on you. I asked you to change the subject and you&rsquo;re still
      thinking about Sam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she agreed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still thinking of Sam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and Sam!&rdquo; he repeated, looking incredulously at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie nodded. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose to his feet. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure, Effie? You&rsquo;re sure you don&rsquo;t know about
      him yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you do know about me? Effie, I&rsquo;ve got to ask. Are you sure about
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She met his eyes bravely, knowing that she must hurt. She was sure she did
      not love Stewart, who was free, and not sure about Branstone, who was
      married. &ldquo;I am quite, quite sure, Dubby,&rdquo; she said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not the sort that pesters, but if you want
      me, Effie, if you find you want me, I&rsquo;ll be there. I... I suppose I&rsquo;d
      better go now. It will take some doing to change the subject after this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dubby, I&rsquo;m sorry. You&rsquo;re not well, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could see him trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that, old thing,&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;Not pity. That would make me
      really ill. Love&rsquo;s just a thing that happens along, but one starter
      doesn&rsquo;t make a race.&rdquo; He held out his hand. &ldquo;Well, doctor&rsquo;s orders to go
      to bed early. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Dubby,&rdquo; she said, and added hesitatingly: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come on
      Sunday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t love and run away. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat for a long while staring into vacancy, then found that something
      wet was dropping on her hands. She bathed her eyes and took the novel up
      again. A proposal occupied, she found, twelve pages of turgid, emotional
      dialogue; but, of course, her experience might be limited. Certainly it
      did not confirm the book&rsquo;s verbosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was quite sure that she did not want Dubby Stewart. He did not strike
      her as humorous at all.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX&mdash;EFFIE IN LOVE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>EVERAL causes
      combined to make her think of Sam, too, as not at all humorous when she
      saw him in the morning. Unlike him, she was not at her best in the early
      hours of the day, and the strain of arriving at an office by nine a.m. was
      one from which she did not recover for some time. She hated business, but
      without that cross of early rising she might have found it almost
      tolerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      She woke that day to her landlady&rsquo;s rap more resentfully than usual. The
      world was disgustingly mismanaged. Why couldn&rsquo;t she love Dubby, who was
      free? She couldn&rsquo;t, but she hated Sam for being married, he had no right
      to be married. &ldquo;Damn Mrs. Sam! Damn her!&rdquo; she said heartily, by way of a
      morning prayer, as she ran hairpins viciously into her glorious hair. &ldquo;But
      I&rsquo;ll cure him of mud,&rdquo; she added, as she raced downstairs to swallow the
      tea and toast which she took almost in the same rush that carried her from
      her bedroom to the tram.
    </p>
    <p>
      She reached the office and walked into Sam&rsquo;s room to find him already in
      possession. His obvious briskness at that hour struck her as almost
      indecent; it was, at any rate, another cause for resentment, and one of
      which he was himself quite blandly unaware.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not stealing a march upon her any more than he habitually stole
      marches on the rest of the world. He knew that early morning suited him,
      and used it to advantage. They were certain in town that Branstone had
      luck rather than brains because he was lazy; but if a man arrives at his
      office at eight a.m., and puts in two hours of solid work by ten o&rsquo;clock,
      he is well ahead of his fellows of the employing class who go down to
      offices on the 9.21 from home. He can afford to appear lazy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He liked that uninterrupted hour with the books, opened the letters
      himself, and had them annotated before the men came, whose business it was
      to deal with their contents. He planned out the day&rsquo;s work, and saw it in
      hand before his earliest caller came. After ten, which is the first hour
      when it is etiquette for a salesman to call, Sam was never too busy to
      talk of matters which were not strictly business&mdash;with the right, the
      gainful caller. It was known that one could kill time pleasantly with
      Branstone. Branstone was a lazy fellow, and his office a good place to sit
      in on a wet afternoon, when there was no point in going to Old Trafford.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came this morning even earlier than usual, to be ready for Effie when
      she came at nine. He had slept off his embarrassment, and was ready in his
      early morning ebullience to pooh-pooh it. It was stupid to be so
      extraordinarily sensitive about an aitch. Accent had always troubled him,
      but he need not overrate its importance, and especially now that he wore
      the political badge of a democrat, and had acknowledged publicly that his
      mother was a charwoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he was here, installed in his chair with the back of his morning&rsquo;s work
      broken, waiting for her when she came.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, she decided, not at all humorous to-day: formidable, in fact. He had
      all the advantages; he was seated; he was first upon the ground, and that
      ground his own, and he was abominably awake. He might have run away
      yesterday, but this was the morning of retrieval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; he said, assuming an attitude of leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; she said, then saw that he was looking quizzically at the
      parcel she carried, as if, she thought, he mistook it for her lunch. &ldquo;I
      took the novel home to finish,&rdquo; she explained nervously, and called
      herself a fool for giving him this readymade chance to open the subject
      which of all things she wanted to delay until her suaver hour had come.
      She might be able to cure him of mud, but a doctor should have a bedside
      manner, and she distrusted her manners until the landlady&rsquo;s knock had
      ceased ringing in her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she had not given him the chance, he would have made it. He gave no
      quarter to bad starters. Had he known of her weakness, he might have
      spared her. He might, because she was Effie; but it wasn&rsquo;t his habit to
      indulge the weaknesses of others, especially a weakness which he did not
      share, did not understand, and denied to be anything but sloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said encouragingly. &ldquo;And the verdict?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does my verdict matter, Mr. Branstone?&rdquo; she asked. He hadn&rsquo;t given her
      time to get her jacket off!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Certainly it matters. I wasn&rsquo;t asking you to waste your time when I
      gave you the manuscript to read. The question is whether we ought to
      publish it, and the answer depends on your opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that quite fair&mdash;to the author, I mean? My opinions of novels are
      inexpert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That author can take care of himself very well,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;He
      won&rsquo;t starve if we refuse his novel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid my opinions are also intolerant,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;I should like to hear them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They might infuriate you, and&mdash;well, I&rsquo;d rather not be sacked if I
      can help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will forget that it is in my power to sack you. Does that satisfy
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, how she loathed people who could be magnanimous at nine a.m.! &ldquo;You are
      being very kind,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are not giving me your opinion. Come, Miss Mannering, you&rsquo;ve read
      it. What do you think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later in the day she might have put it more gently. Just now she could
      manage nothing more kindly than: &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s appalling. It&rsquo;s false from
      start to finish,&rdquo; and she rejoiced to see how much her vehement candour
      disconcerted him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve drawn first blood,&rdquo; she thought; but bleeding as a
      curative process is discredited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is very like others of my series. I made sure it would
      be popular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a judge of that. It&rsquo;s possible enough. And now&rdquo;&mdash;she smiled
      a little wryly&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you know my opinion of the series. I
      warned you,&rdquo; she added hastily, &ldquo;that my opinions were intolerant. I
      imagine you will not ask for them again.&rdquo; She turned resolutely to the
      typewriter and took its cover off. She thought she had closed the
      discussion, and was suiting action to her word, and sitting at her desk
      when he motioned her back to the chair opposite his. It was not the sort
      of motion one ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may ask for them again or I may not,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but in the meantime I
      have certainly not given you anything to do at that machine, and we were
      trying to forget that you are my typist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought after what I&rsquo;ve said that it might be time to remember it,&rdquo; she
      suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;I get to the bottom of things, and, if you
      please, we&rsquo;ll have this out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, if this is part of your secretary&rsquo;s work&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she
      began.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cut her short. &ldquo;It is. Now, you find my novel series appalling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Effie was growing angry. <i>In vino veritas</i>&mdash;and in anger. &ldquo;I
      could go even further,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I find it degrading.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thumped the desk. &ldquo;But it sells, Miss Mannering, it sells. Did you know
      that?&rdquo; He leant back in his chair in one of the attitudes he took when he
      was scoring heavily, thumbs in his waistcoat arm-holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most popular series of cheap novels on the market. See any
      bookstall, if you doubt me.&rdquo; He paused for her apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effle did not apologize. &ldquo;That does not alter my opinion of it,&rdquo; she said
      coolly. &ldquo;A public danger isn&rsquo;t less dangerous because it&rsquo;s large. I&rsquo;m
      afraid I can believe that there are no depths to which it is impossible to
      degrade the public taste, but that does not make me like any the better a
      series which degrades it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now a child is a child. It may be deformed, and its begetter may in
      clairvoyant moments have acknowledged the deformity to himself, but he
      resents its being pointed out to him. Sam was the father of his series.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say!&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nasty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nasty series,&rdquo; she said hardily. &ldquo;You are proud of it because it
      sells when you ought to be ashamed of it because it&rsquo;s bad.&rdquo; Somehow she
      had to say it. She couldn&rsquo;t hedge from what she saw as truth, even though
      she expected truth to hurt him and to be hurt in return. But Sam
      wonderfully controlled himself. Emphatically, he was forgetting that she
      was a typist. He remembered that she was Effie.
    </p>
    <p>
      He addressed the ceiling. &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; he mourned, &ldquo;that women do not
      understand business. Even business women don&rsquo;t. Even you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mentally she thanked him for his &ldquo;even you.&rdquo; It seemed to her a good place
      to end the matter for that morning. She still distrusted her manners, and
      not, she thought, without reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consequently,&rdquo; she told him quietly, &ldquo;my opinion cannot matter,&rdquo; and
      moved as if to go to her typewriter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held her to her seat. &ldquo;That is to beg the question,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and
      we were to have it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she tried, &ldquo;you have told me that I do not understand business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you did not believe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He challenged her, in fact. Well, she must pick up his gage. &ldquo;I do not
      understand this about business, Mr. Branstone. What is it about business
      which makes a man like you content to be a confectioner selling people
      wares that give them mental indigestion? Business! It&rsquo;s the name for half
      the meanness and nine-tenths of the ugliness in the world. You see, women
      do know something about business to-day. It isn&rsquo;t their fault that they
      are not still sitting cosily at home, hugging the old belief that business
      is a dignified, majestic thing to which only the masculine intellect can
      rise. It&rsquo;s your fault, the men&rsquo;s. You wanted cheap clerks, and you raised
      the veil so that women have seen business at close quarters, and the only
      thing they do not understand is how men continued for so long to magnify
      its low chicane and its infinite humbug into a cult which deceived them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam came to the conclusion that Effie was not perfect. She suffered from
      hysteria, but she must be answered. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t think much
      of business. But you came into it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I needed money,&rdquo; she defended that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; he said dryly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re birds of a feather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hate it, too?&rdquo; she asked hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honestly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I like it. But,&rdquo; he went on with mischief in his
      eye, &ldquo;I can tell you something that will please you. You dislike the novel
      series. You think they degrade. You don&rsquo;t think the Classics degrade?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would much rather that the Classics sold largely than the novels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; She was eager now. &ldquo;Because they are great literature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. That would be being sentimental about business, and it can&rsquo;t be done.
      Because they are not copyright, and it saves book-keeping.&rdquo; He grinned at
      her discomfiture. &ldquo;Business,&rdquo; he defined, &ldquo;is money-getting.&rdquo; He was
      feeling tremendously pleased with himself, her master in argument. He gave
      her rope indulgently, for she was Effie; then crushed her utterly, for he
      was Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it better,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;to win a little money decently than to gain
      a great deal by trading in poison? Whether you know it or not, these books
      are poisonous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know it,&rdquo; he said brusquely. &ldquo;They give pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, I suppose, does opium. There are lots of pleasant poisons. Would you
      keep an opium den if it paid? If you were a milkman, would you adulterate
      milk and poison babies? You adulterate books and poison minds. For money!
      Oh, yes; I, too, needed money, and I, too, came to business. But we are
      not birds of a feather. I do not like business. I don&rsquo;t like having to get
      money. I don&rsquo;t like money, but I need it. I&rsquo;ve things to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My case again,&rdquo; he capped her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve things to do with it.&rdquo; He saw that
      she was looking at him curiously, and that she took him to mean that he
      wanted money for Ada. Incidentally he did, but essentially he did not.
      &ldquo;Politics,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Power! Power!&rdquo; He repeated the word ecstatically,
      not only because he was admitting her to the intimacy of his private
      thought, not only because he felt it an ecstatic idea, but because he had
      so thoroughly defeated her in argument. She sat there staring
      speechlessly, and he exulted to perceive that she was mute before his
      slashing common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only, that was not the reason of her silence. She thought that, for a
      first attempt, she had gone far enough, and had the hope that something of
      what she had said would remain in his mind, perhaps stingingly. She could
      only hope. Heaven knew it had been a queer enough interview between an
      employer and his typist, and her prayer, as she sat there permitting his
      exultation, was for an interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her prayer was answered. Just as she thought him on the brink of seeing
      that her silence was not entirely acquiescent, the office-boy brought in
      the name of a caller he must see, and Effie rose with huge relief. She
      hadn&rsquo;t it in her to keep silent much longer, and felt that if she then let
      go all that was firing her, she would say more than he could stand. True,
      he had stood a good deal, but then she had said little of what she had to
      say! She wanted to say it gradually, to lead him, not to spur him, to her
      point of view. Already she was taking a more modern view of the virtues of
      bleeding her patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought, too, that his was the easier part.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had ideals for her Sam, but when she attempted to define them, they
      seemed nebulous, indeed, against his simple practice of expediency. He had
      his theory that what was expedient was just, and she&mdash;what was her
      theory except that his was not good enough for him? And his was in
      possession everywhere, established, honoured, received of all but a
      trivial minority. He thought with the mass and she thought mass-thinking
      was not good enough for him. It was difficult to explain. He wasn&rsquo;t a
      criminal, he wasn&rsquo;t even individual in thought or method; he played the
      common game, playing perhaps a little more astutely than the average, but
      keeping honestly within the rules. He followed the crowd, and she wanted
      him to follow the gleam. A gleam is indefinable, but she thought she had a
      chance because she was so much more grown-up than Sam. Business was a game
      of marbles, and girls do not play with marbles, but with dolls.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not to remain for long with the delusion that he had silenced her
      in their first talk. There followed many other talks, although she was
      coming to the conclusion that talking would not do the business for her.
      It helped, it made a preparation of the ground, but it was stubborn clay
      in which he had his roots. Talking did not dig deep enough; she must
      uproot, she must transplant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Politics,&rdquo; he had said to pulverize her argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another thing,&rdquo; she told him, &ldquo;which is not quite the mystery for women
      that it was. Politics, but&mdash;why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he replied with the word which had raised him to ecstasy. &ldquo;Power,&rdquo;; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she questioned. &ldquo;Business leads you to money, money to politics,
      and politics to power. And after that? You want power&mdash;for what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;power is power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An end in itself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, it&rsquo;s an ambition,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, and so had Ada had her ambition to be married, an end, <i>the</i>
      end. He did not think of Ada, but he found it difficult to justify
      himself. He could not even tell her that he was a Liberal, because he had
      a decent hatred of a Tory; he wasn&rsquo;t in politics for a faith which enabled
      him to endure their artifice; he relished the artifice, he was in with an
      axe to grind, but with no clear idea of the use he wished to make of his
      axe when it was sharp. Ambition, purpose narrowed to two letters&mdash;M.P.
      He wanted to be M.P. for Branstone, that Bran-stone might hear the voice
      of Branstone speaking in the House of Commons.
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched him slyly, and thought her leaven worked. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she
      said casually, &ldquo;it would be useful for your business if you were an M.P.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enormously,&rdquo; he agreed, marching blindly into her little trap. &ldquo;It gives
      prestige to any business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And completes the vicious circle,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Business takes you to
      politics and politics brings you back to business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He remembered an appointment hastily, and went to keep it. Sam Branstone
      stumped for a reply was an unusual phenomenon, and she con gratulated
      herself again that it worked. It worked, but slowly. She was not
      impatient, but he was still doing unchanged the things she hated to see
      him do, and she wanted the change to come. She doubted that it would ever
      come by talk alone. One did not convert by conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had intended to say so much, to keep a steady pressure on him, and she
      couldn&rsquo;t do it, partly because her point of view was difficult of
      definition, partly because she thought no talk, no matter how inspired,
      could change him of itself. She did not know of Anne, who had talked and
      kept the pres sure up, and put sacrifice behind the talk even to the point
      of thrusting her hand into the fire; but Effie, too, had sacrifice in
      mind. Anne&rsquo;s sacrifice had failed. It wasn&rsquo;t, perhaps, the right
      sacrifice: it was, at any rate, the immortal commonplace, the sacrifice of
      the older generation to the younger, of the mother to the son, of age to
      youth. Spectacular, heroic as it was, it was yet in the scheme of things,
      and it is the sacrifice of youth to youth which can surprise by
      unexpectedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some it is a sacrifice to cease talking even when they are convinced
      that talk is futile. If Effie was one of these, she made that little
      sacrifice at once. She never told him that his life was mean and ugly and
      despicable, his triumphs worthless, his success a failure, his highest
      ambition to know that people grovelled to him, his money and his power.
      She did not say these things, but neither did she yield an inch of her
      attitude which implied them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll win,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll win.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By now she was crusading for the soul of Sammy Branstone, and all the
      while her passion grew, fed as much by that in him which irritated her as
      by what attracted. She accepted the fact that he was married and
      discounted it. It was one with the other irritants, mattering less to her,
      for it was irremovable. She could neglect the wife: what mattered was the
      man. She must bring beauty to his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      They have tamed many wild things in a world growm standardized; they have
      tried for centuries to bridle love and make it run in harness; but love
      refuses to be tamed and standardized by the marriage service. You don&rsquo;t
      scare love away by the bogey-sign, &ldquo;Trespassers will be prosecuted.&rdquo;
       Love&rsquo;s wild, it&rsquo;s free, blind to the handcuffs which Church and State
      pathetically try to rivet on a given pair, lawless because it knows no
      law, timeless because it know&rsquo;s no time. Sometimes it lasts while a
      butterfly could suck a flower&rsquo;s honey, sometimes the space of a man&rsquo;s
      life, and they have tried to regulate this love, this volatility, to
      pretend that because it sometimes does not evaporate, it never evaporates
      till death. They sought to link love with property, and to control the
      uncontrollable. They make laws round love, which is like enclosing an
      eagle in a cobweb; and we suffer for their laws. We keep the law and
      suffer; break it and we suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew that she would suffer, but she would bring beauty to Sam. He
      hadn&rsquo;t capitulated to her talk, and she thought that he had no chance in
      Manchester. Perhaps her Sam was with her in his dreams, but each dawn
      brought him to accustomed ugliness, and habit clogged his days with mud.
      He couldn&rsquo;t escape, he wanted wings, and she was there to bring them him.
      He did not know there was another side to life, but she would show it him.
      He should see her beauty, and, through that, the beauty of the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was presumptuous, but presumption is a quality of faith. She
      interfered, but there are three inevitable interferences in life&mdash;birth,
      love and death&mdash;and hers was one of these. It was them all: it was
      love and the birth of the new Sam, and the death of the old. She
      interfered, where she had right to interfere. She loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time passed between the day when she came to her decision and the day when
      they acted upon it, and she never knew how long it was nor how she spent
      it. She belonged to a living fact, and there were shadows in the world,
      such as her work, her mother, the silly detail of arranging to go away,
      and Stewart, a haunting shadow of one Sunday afternoon, but these were
      unrealities and only her idea was real. She never remembered how she put
      it to Sam, nor what he said, though she had a hazy memory that he was
      desperately shocked and more profoundly humorous than ever before. But she
      thought that he was only shocked as the right thing shocks by rightness,
      not as the wrong by wrongness: and she knew that difficulties melted: and
      they came.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came to the Marbeck Inn and entered into their kingdom of a week.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX&mdash;THE MARBECK INN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>AM was vilely dull
      about it all at first: his comprehension, stuck in the mud, failed utterly
      to rise to the occasion, but before long; he was looking back with horror
      on his turgid mental processes when she told him that they would come away
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a shadow, not more than a shadow of excuse for his preposterous
      misunderstanding of her ease. Sam followed the crowd, accepted readymade
      their principles and their lack of principles, their morality and their
      immorality, and to the crowd he followed the theory was faithfulness and
      the practice as much licence as they could take without being found out.
      They made a boast rather than a secret of their affairs with a shopgirl or
      a typist, he had never had an affair and was flattered to think that he
      was to have one now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought that an affair was rather a manly thing to have.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Effie spoke, he had a great surprise, then cheapened her insultingly.
      He decided that he had been wrong about her. After all, she was nothing
      more than a pretty typist with whom he was going to have his first affair,
      who was going to give him the opportunity to join in that sly boasting in
      hotel smoke-rooms which was the habit of his crowd. He, too, would rank
      amongst the sportsmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, even at his worst, he had the grace to doubt that this was of the
      same kind as those other affairs. It had a lowest common measure with
      them, but&mdash;Effie! Cheapen her as he would, he could not think of her
      as cheap enough for that. When others did this thing it was, surely, that
      they were giving rein to grossness: it was at least charitable to assume
      that the women of their amours were of coarser grain than their wives, and
      Effie&rsquo;s was not the coarser grain. He drifted, acquiescing and puzzled,
      through the fog of his perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Illumination came to him, not in the crowded railway carriage, but in the
      trap which drove them from the station to the Inn. It came, he thought,
      miraculously, but perhaps the miracle was nothing more than that a man
      sees clearly in Westmoreland, and sees through dirt in Manchester. He
      worshipped Effie who was sacrificing all to him, and with abasement at the
      thought that he had meant, with his pitiful achievements, to surprise her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, shepherded to joy at the Marbeck Inn had set out to surprise Effie!
      That was what made it, from the first dawn of understanding, a perfect
      wonder-tale. He had not calculated this; it happened, like a dream, in the
      air, unrooted in prevision. But that was all it had, except its rapt
      intensity, of the quality of dream. It was dreamlike because it was more
      vivid than his experience of life, but it was life. Only, he had not known
      these things about life before. He had underestimated life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inn lay in a saucer of the hills at the end of a road which led to
      nowhere. As a road, it finished at the Inn and went on only as a rough
      cart-track which dwindled and divided into two trails across the passes.
      The fells came down in grandeur to the Inn&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t a place from
      which one looked at distant hills, but one where the hills were intimately
      there&mdash;and half a mile away there was the Lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were twelve miles from a station, at the end of the world, alone with
      happiness. Of course, there were other people at the Inn, but Sam and
      Effie were alone: they two with the heather and the bracken and the pines:
      they two with love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd has not discovered Marbeck. The Inn, the Church, the Vicarage,
      down by the Lake the Hall, a farmhouse or two along the road, and that is
      all. Six miles away there is a post-office.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had followed the crowd on his rare holidays. He knew Blackpool
      Promenade and Morecambe and the things to do at Douglas. Here, one did not
      do those things. One walked and climbed and lay extended on the heather or
      in the perfect isolation of high bracken, and bathed in the Lake or the
      streams or the tarns, haphazard, naked, where one liked and when one
      liked; and all the time one breathed the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      It needed no thunderous knocking on the door to get her out of bed into
      the Marbeck air. Sam would go for an early dip in the pool below the Inn
      where two streams cascaded into a swimmable basin, and when he returned
      she would be up or ready to get up that he might brush her hair, or not up
      that she might play at being peevish and be lifted out of bed by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the food, the good rough plenty of the Marbeck Inn! They ate of it
      prodigiously and carried to the hills parcels of sandwiches and cakes and
      cheese, shamelessly large, which they emptied to the last crumb, and eked
      out in the woods with raspberries and nuts.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took him on the Lake, with a rod borrowed from the Inn, and showed him
      how to fish. He relished it amazingly, catching little but the spirit of
      the thing, happy because of the green reflection of the woods in the water
      and because of her. His restlessness found pause in a boat with Effie and
      she noted with a keen delight that he did not envy the expert basket of
      the postman who cycled to Marbeck in the mornings and fished till he
      cycled away with the letters in the afternoon. She registered as a happy
      gain that he did not want to shine, or try to beat that seasoned fisher at
      his game. Nor did the posts distract them. They had no letters there.
    </p>
    <p>
      They bathed continually, for it was hot, and here again he made no effort
      to excel, but let it be admitted that she was the better swimmer. How much
      the better she did not let him know. She knew that he found the water here
      a purer element than in the old Blackfriars Baths where he had learnt when
      he was at school, and she tired less rapidly than he did. But he was
      wondrously content to own inferiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a deep symbolic faith in bathing. They were here to wash his mud
      away, and water was cleaner than talk. Talk, indeed, was but a surface
      pattern of their time. They hardly needed it, except as levity to mitigate
      a deep communion which sometimes grew almost intolerably sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Blea Tarn, one of the many of that name, which they made peculiarly
      theirs, their favourite bathing-place, their best lunch-room. Effie
      stretched herself luxuriously on the close-cropped turf, at peace in mind
      and body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;have you noticed that Frump at the Inn? She sits behind
      me at dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sam truthfully. &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m with you I notice nobody else. And I
      don&rsquo;t know how you saw her if she sits behind you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eyes in the back of my head,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;You have them when you&rsquo;re a
      woman. Do you mind if I give her a shock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would if she could see you now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes, but she doesn&rsquo;t
      deserve it,&rdquo; said Effie complacently. She surveyed herself and Sam did the
      same. She pleased them both, taking her sun-bath there on the mossy turf.
      &ldquo;But I may shock her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may do anything,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God for that,&rdquo; said Effie joyously, and something glittered in the
      sun and fell with a splash far into the tarn. &ldquo;Too deep to dive for it,&rdquo;
       she decided. &ldquo;Bang goes a shilling and I&rsquo;m glad. I never liked pretence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say!&rdquo; Sam protested, and then fell silent comprehendingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him and greeted his silence with a nod. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t catch
      cold,&rdquo; she said, holding up her finger where the wedding ring had been. &ldquo;I
      feel better now I&rsquo;m rid of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The remarkable fact was that Sam understood. His education had progressed
      and he knew that it was not for the Frump at the Inn that she shed the
      imitation wedding ring which for form&rsquo;s sake he had suggested she should
      wear: it was for him. The ring was counterfeit, it was a false symbol of
      something which was not true: it had no place in the Marbeck scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      She curled up happily like a stroked cat, partly in sheer physical
      well-being, partly in gladness at her scheme&rsquo;s success. &ldquo;And to think,&rdquo;
       she crooned, &ldquo;that I am a wicked woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Effie,&rdquo; he pleaded, taking her hand. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if I care,&rdquo; she said, rolling over on to her back and taking his hand
      with her to shade her eyes. &ldquo;I might have been doing this all my life.&rdquo;
       Indeed, in her perfect absence of embarrassment, she might. &ldquo;Wicked!&rdquo; She
      shied a stone after the wedding ring into the tarn and laughed at a world
      well lost. &ldquo;The Frump won&rsquo;t understand, my dear, but I think you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I do,&rdquo; said Sam, but the fullness of understanding had not come
      to him yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something, indeed, of her fineness he did perceive, but not its whole, its
      utter selflessness. He saw, roughly, what she was after: that it was here,
      in Westmoreland when she made her sacrifice, here when she lay beside him
      in the sun that she expressed in deed what she had been baffled to express
      in Manchester. She had brought him away from the murk and the fog and the
      place where they rather like dirt than otherwise because dirt means money,
      to where nature was beautiful. She had shown him beauty there, her beauty
      and the beauty of sacrifice and the beauty of things. She had taught him
      that there was beauty in the world. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never go back,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Not back,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But we will go to Manchester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. No. We&rsquo;ll build a tabernacle here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here? No. We&rsquo;ve been lawless here. We&rsquo;ll go to Manchester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It rang in his ears like the trump of doom. So far they had marched in
      thought together, and he imagined that in her scheme they were to be
      together to the end. He thought her purpose was that they two were to work
      together to give shape to beauty&mdash;and no bad exercise in perception,
      either, for Sam Branstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was her purpose, but, as she saw it, they were not to work together
      in the sense he meant. Her spirit was to go on with him, but she herself
      would stand aside, denying herself the right and the joy of sharing his
      work with him in physical partnership. She would have done her share at
      Marbeck: she was a sign-post whose direction he was to follow but which he
      left behind, not a guide to go with him on his way: and she thought she
      was content with that.
    </p>
    <p>
      She renounced and she imagined that of the two of them it was she who was
      the realist and he who was romantic, he was romantic because he wanted her
      with him and she the realist because she remembered Ada. She was not
      jealous of Ada no&rsquo;; if she could not bless Ada, neither did she damn her.
      Ada had never held him as Effie held him now. She thought it satisfied her
      to know that she held him, and to let the days slip past uncounted.
      Nothing is infinite except our human capacity for self-deception.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the present, for the Marbeck heyday, it did satisfy her, and she went
      about the business of her tutelage with the unruffled serenity of
      fulfilled purpose, almost involuntarily now, thinking little, feeling
      everything in the passionate intensity of her sacramental love. It would
      end and she would suffer: meantime there were only so many days and it was
      no use impairing finite days with regrets that they were not infinite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thought was for before and afterwards, not for now when she crusaded for
      the soul of Sammy Branstone with the mystic rapture of a trance, joyful
      like the other sorts of true religion. She would wake up, but she would
      have taught Sam his lesson; she would have given him his gleam; and she
      was selfless after that....
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course she may have deceived herself. There is spiritual love, but
      Effie was flesh and blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam, at any rate, was not etherealizing things. He did not appreciate the
      happiness of renouncing happiness. He wanted it to last, to go on with the
      gay days on the hills when she put health into his body and health into
      his mind, when it was all a high-spirited riot without an undertow. For
      hours on end, they lived their lives unclouded by a thought... rude,
      rough, exhilarating exercise on the glamorous fells like that illustrious
      day when they climbed the Pike and lost themselves in mist and found
      themselves again just where they wished to be, on the downward trail by
      Corner Tarn to Yorkdale: then on the steamer down the Lake, and the lonely
      moonlight walk across the Moor to Branley, where the trap from the Inn met
      them and took them, comfortably tired, to Marbeck and a giant&rsquo;s feast. And
      there were other days, more leisured, on their Lake or in the woods when
      more seemed to happen in his soul and less in his body; and their day of
      Bathes, in five well separated tarns, with a makeweight bathe in the
      Marsland Beck for luck. He wanted it to last. He had intoxication of the
      hills, of her, of everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not seen, he would not and he could not, see the possibility of her
      leaving him. He did not know that leaving him was as fundamental a part of
      her plan as coming to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go hack to Manchester,&rdquo; she said, and it seemed to him that he was
      ordered hack to hell. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where your business is,&rdquo; she added, a little
      wickedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Business! Hadn&rsquo;t she shown him the ugliness of his business, and the
      beauty of Marbeck? Why should they ever leave the hills? He had all the
      extremity of a convert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie would say no more, and now, as the end of their time grew near, the
      magic seemed to him less magical, because he had to leave it, because she
      would not stay for ever in that lonely place, but wanted him to go where
      other men lived, in an ugly town, where he had a business she had taught
      him to despise, and responsibilities, and Ada.
    </p>
    <p>
      He plunged to gloom. What was the use of knowing that there was light if
      he must go back to darkness? Was it not treachery in her to come so far
      with him, then leave him to himself?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Effie!&rdquo; he pleaded, and she consented to make things clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see, Sam? We&rsquo;ve done what we came here to do. You&rsquo;ve seen, you
      know, and you will not slide back. I won&rsquo;t allow you to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t allow! Then you&rsquo;ll be there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope my spirit will be always there,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you doubt that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spirit?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re overrating me. You&rsquo;re asking more than I can
      give. I cannot give what isn&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve put it there,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You cannot fail. You can&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      * &ldquo;I&rsquo;d not forget, but I should fail. It&rsquo;s we, my dear. Not I alone, but
      you and I. Without you I am lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made a great concession. &ldquo;Then, if you&rsquo;re sure&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure,&rdquo; he said, and she decided to indulge his weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t dismiss your secretary. Then I&rsquo;ll be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As secretary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of, of course.&rdquo; She spoke impatiently. All else was at the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      That only made it more impossible than ever. She was to be there&mdash;and
      not to be there. There, in his office where he would see her every day,
      where he had only to stretch out his hand to touch her, and where he was
      not to touch, where he was to forget that he had ever touched. He wanted
      her, all of her, the touch, the glow, the life of her, and she offered&mdash;what?
      A sexless wraith, a spiritual guide, her presence in asceticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;d rather die than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, death is a good arrangement, Sam, but well be brave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are limits even to bravery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the realist. &ldquo;There are none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So she sent him, though he did not know that the suggestion came from her,
      to gather strength in the peace of the everlasting hills. She sent him to
      Hartle Pike to think, to see that she was right. He would remember Ada
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did remember Ada, but it seemed to him, when he tried to sum up his
      recollections, that Ada was not the woman who counted in his life. The
      women who counted were before Ada and after Ada. They were Anne and Effie.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the gathering dusk on Hartle Pike he tried to be cool about it and to
      see things in proportion. Effie had the supreme advantage of immediacy. It
      wasn&rsquo;t easy, whilst he lived encircled by her glamour, to see Ada at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had been Ada&rsquo;s husband for ten years, a long time, more than a
      quarter of his life. In all those years there must be something which he
      could positively remember of her, some definite characteristic; something,
      at any rate, which was individual to her. He searched and found nothing.
      She had less individuality in his mind than his sideboard. He supposed
      that she kept house, or did she? Didn&rsquo;t he recall that the cook&rsquo;s wages
      went up one year, and that the cook became cook-housekeeper? In that case,
      and he felt certain of it now, Ada did nothing. He was equally certain
      that she was nothing. Since he had grown accustomed to her demands for
      money, she was not even an irritant. She was a standing charge, like the
      warehouse rent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite suddenly, as he lingered over that definition of his wife, &ldquo;a
      standing charge,&rdquo; he saw that it was double-edged. It cut at him, and
      shrewdly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ada, like Effie, was a woman, and he knew from Effie what a woman could
      be. There must, at least, have been possibilities in Ada. Dear God, what
      had he done with them if she was nothing now? That was the charge&mdash;that
      he had married her and that she was nothing: that he had permitted her to
      become nothing. He could summon no witness for his defence, he remembered
      no occasion when he had fought for Ada, as Effie had fought for him. And
      as to sacrifice&mdash;&mdash;! Yet he was supposed to have loved Ada.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could have howled for very shame, he could not, in fairness, think that
      Ada had given him anything, but writhed that he had thought just now of
      Anne and Effie as the two women who counted in his life. They were the
      women who gave. Was he to take all from women and render nothing to a woman
      in return? If he could say of Ada, his wife these last ten years, that she
      did not count, then he was very much to blame and the path was clear
      before him. He saw to where the gleam that Effie gave him pointed. To Ada.
      It annoyed him desperately that it should point to Ada.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to descend the hill in a cold fury. The world was hideous,
      Marbeck an illusion, Effie a fool. No: Effie was right. One could not run
      away from facts and hide one&rsquo;s head amongst the hills, and say there were
      no facts. She had not brought him there to obscure facts, but to reveal
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It remained to face them, to return to Manchester with new knowledge and
      new courage. It needed courage to turn his back on Marbeck, to go away
      from happiness to Ada.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stamped upon that thought, as on a snake. It was disloyalty to Effie
      who had sacrificed to him and shown him all the beauty of her sacrifice.
      He, too, would sacrifice and find a beauty in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found it extraordinarily difficult to meet Effie, and spent an
      unnecessarily long time with the landlord of the Inn. Then he went in to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stay another night. By driving
      fifteen miles I can catch the South Mail at midnight. I&rsquo;ve arranged for
      you to come to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He jerked each sentence out painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie met his eyes with her serene gaze. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s infinitely best,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had seen! It was her victory, complete and unequivocal, and she was
      proud of him and of herself. He had got rid of mud and he had seen beauty.
      Now he was facing the facts as she would have him face them, clear-eyed,
      without romance. Like her, he was a realist, and she was glad... glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he went up to their room to pack his bag, Effie left the Inn
      quickly and walked hard. She must put space between them: space, that she
      might cry unheard. It seemed to her that if he heard her crying he would
      not go, and she wanted him to go. She was a realist. She was... stifling
      her sobs amongst the heather; triumphing in victory on Marbeck Ridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      She won, as she had said that she would win. But there were limits to her
      bravery.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI&mdash;SATAN&rsquo;S SMILE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE theory that
      Satan is a subtle devil is one which will not bear examination. He is a
      crude fellow, theatrical, Mephistophelean. It may, of course, be only
      because his experience of human nature has made a cynic of him, and
      certainly his interferences do not as a rule lack success because they
      want delicacy. He attacked Sam with a blatant effrontery which suggested
      that he thought Sam&rsquo;s a contemptuously easy case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam reached Manchester very early in the morning, and spent the rest of
      his broken night in a lugubrious hotel near the station. Manchester hotels
      rarely make for gaiety, but it is wonderful what even a short night will
      do in the way of altering a point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      He expected to be depressed at the very air of Manchester, and, instead,
      he sniffed at it as Mr. Minnifie had once relished the odours of
      Greenheys, with an exile&rsquo;s greed. He knew that he ought to feel a loathing
      of the office, but found that he opened the letters with more than his
      usual zest. He knew that it was wrong, all wrong, and checked his itching
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      There have been prisoners who, when offered freedom, have pleaded to
      remain in the familiar cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it like that with him, he wondered, as had as that, the jail-fever so
      ineradically in him that he must breathe the tainted air to live? But, was
      he offered freedom? He had to go to Ada, who was a mill-stone and implied
      the other mill-stones. Unless she was not a mill-stone, unless he could
      alter her. In the meantime, at all events, she was not altered, she wanted
      the things which she had always wanted; and the office was their source.
      It seemed to him that he was still in prison, with the difference that he
      now knew that it was prison. He found little comfort in the knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      His gaze returned to the pile of correspondence. There seemed nothing else
      for it to do, and he saw an envelope, addressed not to the firm, but to
      himself, which sent the blood whirling to his head in simple premonition
      of its contents. From the postmark (S.W.&mdash;Satan&rsquo;s Work?) he saw that
      it had only come that morning and had not been waiting his arrival. He
      thought of that as of a portent. Suppose he had stayed another day at
      Marbeck! He might have been too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a careful letter, but the facts were that, owing to the sudden
      death of Sir Almeric Pannifer, the seat tor the Sandyford Division of
      Marlshire was vacated. Mr. Morphew, who had reduced Sir Almeric&rsquo;s majority
      in that agricultural constituency to three hundred was, for private
      reasons, unable to stand again (&ldquo;I know these private reasons,&rdquo; thought
      Sam. &ldquo;Morphew considers he has earned a walkover next time&rdquo;), but
      Headquarters were of opinion that a resolute candidate of strong
      personality, etc....
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, he was offered the opportunity to be the figurehead in a
      demonstration for the Liberal Party. It was no more than that. Morphew had
      doubtless nursed the constituency like a mother, and if at the landslide
      of the last election he had done no better than to come within three
      hundred of his opponents&rsquo; votes, the chances of a stranger&rsquo;s capturing the
      seat were negative. But it was the stepping-stone, the <i>liaison</i>
      between obscurity and the House of Commons. It was what he had aimed at.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to believe that the letter did not exhilarate him as it would
      have done a fortnight earlier, and Satan, the connoisseur of good
      resolutions, smiled his age-long smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked across at Effie&rsquo;s chair. &ldquo;My spirit will be always with you,&rdquo;
       she had said; he wondered if it were there now, and tried to see her.
      Surely now, if ever, was her time; now when he had so lately left her,
      when her scent was in his nostrils and her voice in his ears. Her voice <i>was</i>
      in his ears. He heard it clearly. She spoke one word, &ldquo;Renounce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but, my dear,&rdquo; he argued, &ldquo;I have renounced. I&rsquo;ve renounced you.
      I&rsquo;ve come back here and I&rsquo;m going to Ada, to plumb the depths of her, to
      find the good in her, and drag it to the top. I&rsquo;m going to dive for
      pearls,&rdquo; he grew almost picturesque as he cited his intentions towards Ada
      in his defence, &ldquo;and I shall grow short of breath. I&rsquo;m not doubting that
      the pearls are there, because Ada&rsquo;s a woman, and so are you, but I know
      that they lie deep and I want breath for such a dive as that. I&rsquo;ve
      renounced you, and I&rsquo;m going to make a woman of her; don&rsquo;t I deserve some
      recompense to make amends? It&rsquo;s here beneath my hand, and I have only to
      say &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; Effie,&rdquo; he pleaded, &ldquo;if you knew what this meant to me, you
      wouldn&rsquo;t frown. It&rsquo;s not backsliding.&rdquo; He denied that it was backsliding,
      well knowing that it was. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s politics, I know, and you don&rsquo;t like
      politics. You told me women knew about politics now. Oh, but you don&rsquo;t
      know, you don&rsquo;t. Smile at me, Effie, smile as I have seen women smile when
      men talked of golf. I know we men are babies, and so do you. Give me my
      game. It&rsquo;s nothing but a hobby, like golf, but this is mine, and I want it
      so much. Ada is my work and this is my play, and just as necessary. It
      will not be a hindrance to what I have to do for Ada, it will be a help.
      Effie, tell me that I may have my help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to blarney a consenting smile out of the figure of Eflie he
      imagined sitting in her chair. He had no difficulty in imagining her
      there; he saw her, too easily, too really to imagine a false Effie. He
      could not imagine, try as he would, that he had won consent from her. He
      was too near the real Effie for that. And Effie said &ldquo;Renounce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then his cashier came into the office and routine swallowed him for the
      day. A score of little points had arisen in his absence and must be
      discussed and settled. The thought occurred to him that if he telegraphed
      to London in the morning, Headquarters would hear from him as soon as if
      he wrote to-day. They might expect a wire to-day; well, they would not get
      it. He crammed the letter into his pocket and decided that he would sleep
      upon it before he sent them his reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if Satan still smiled it was wistfully, as if he regretted his lost
      subtlety; but there was still Ada, the married woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Ada was nothing else, she was a married woman; in a world where many
      fail, she had succeeded; she had got married, and, like other people who
      have reached their earthly paradise, she did not know what to do when she
      got there, and did nothing. She stopped growing when she married.
    </p>
    <p>
      The emptiness of her life was a thing to marvel at. She slept and ate and
      shopped. She was spared the ordinary duties of running a house, and the
      trials of servants, because the cook, an elderly, reliable woman, took (it
      seemed) a fancy to Sam and became a fixture first and a housekeeper
      second, taking from Ada&rsquo;s shoulders the burden of engaging her underling.
      She had two &ldquo;At homes&rdquo; a week, and went to other people&rsquo;s &ldquo;At homes.&rdquo; On
      Sunday, she went to church, where one can display new clothes to a larger
      audience than at the largest private &ldquo;at home.&rdquo; She killed the evenings
      somehow, in company with a friend, or with the fashion papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evenings interested her little; they were the time when Sam was often, but
      not too often, at home. He was not, strictly, a nuisance, because he never
      asked her, after a first experiment, to entertain a business acquaintance,
      and did that at hotels. Nor did he ask her to entertain him. Usually, he
      read a manuscript, or worked out costs or did something which made no
      demand on Ada, except that she be reasonably quiet. She was very quiet
      with Sam, for the reason that she had nothing to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not go out much in the evenings and told her friends that this was
      because she liked to be at home with her husband. They were supposed to
      deduce an idyll of conjugal bliss where proximity was perfect happiness.
      The real reasons were, first, pure laziness and, second, her shoulders.
      Other married women might expose their shoulders in low-cut dresses, but
      not Ada. It wasn&rsquo;t modest. Her shoulders were ugly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She never went to see Peter, who had given her offence by suggesting the
      blessedness of work. He had dared to lecture her, a married woman, and she
      let fly at him in such fashion that he never tried again, he deplored his
      weakness, but he gave her up. The cobbler&rsquo;s child is the worst shod, and
      something analogous often happens with the daughters of the clergy: Ada
      was, perhaps, the worst of Peter&rsquo;s flock. He knew and, knowing the hopes
      he had had of this marriage, suffered at its failure, but silently,
      confessing impotence. There were always books in which he could forget,
      and the peace which had come to his house since Ada left it. It is not
      easy to be saintly all the time, and her outrageous attack had been,
      humanly speaking, unpardonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be something in her,&rdquo; he told himself, as he left the office,
      &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve to find it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The day had, naturally, after an absence, been unusually busy, and had
      given him no time to think. He was bursting with intention, but it was
      vague, unformed, though urgent and doubly urgent because of the letter in
      his pocket. If he could make a woman of Ada, if that evening he could make
      a fair start, perhaps he could conjure up the figure of Effie, his ghostly
      counsellor, with a smile on her face consenting to his standing for the
      seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Ada greeted him, &ldquo;I thought you were not coming back till Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Something changed my plan a little. I wanted to get
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him resentfully. There was no reason why he should not
      change his plan and come home two days before she expected him, but she
      resented the unexpected. And there was something about him which appeared
      strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me you are glad to see me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it wasn&rsquo;t to be till Saturday,&rdquo; she repeated stupidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you thinking of dinner?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Kate will manage something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was not thinking of dinner, and no doubt Kate would manage something.
      It was Kate&rsquo;s business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wearing funny clothes,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Country clothes,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;ve been in the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; She was not curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. In the country. It was rather beautiful, Ada.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I nearly went with Mrs. Grandage to the &lsquo;Métropole,&rsquo; at Blackpool, but I
      don&rsquo;t like dressing for dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blackpool&rsquo;s not beautiful,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ada, I want to talk to you, and I
      hardly know how to begin, except that I want you to understand that I&rsquo;m in
      earnest. It&rsquo;s a serious matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money?&rdquo; said Ada, sitting up sharply in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not money. We&rsquo;ve both been wrong about money, I think. We&rsquo;ve both taken
      it too seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to tell me that something has gone wrong with your money,
      it&rsquo;s very serious indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t. No. This is a larger thing than money. I want, if I can, to
      alter things between us, Ada. How can I put it? There&rsquo;s your father&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never want to hear his name again,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;He insulted me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go to church, you know; you listen to him there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People would talk if I didn&rsquo;t go. I needn&rsquo;t listen to him when I am in
      church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good old man. I&rsquo;m sorry we have drifted from him. But I&rsquo;ll not
      press that now. If the rest comes right, that will come right with it. It
      might even come so right as to include my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you <i>are</i> digging up the past. I don&rsquo;t see how
      you could call things right when they include me with a charwoman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ada!&rdquo; he protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By her own choice. But please forget that, Ada. Yes, it&rsquo;s true that I am
      digging in the past. I want to go back to see where we went wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Went wrong? When who went wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you and I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know we had gone wrong.&rdquo; She looked at him. &ldquo;You look well,&rdquo; she
      decided, &ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am better than I&rsquo;ve ever been,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and stronger, and if need be
      I shall use my strength, but I hope the need won&rsquo;t come for that. Ada, can
      you tell me this? Can you tell me what it is you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure it&rsquo;s all right about your money?&rdquo; she asked anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course it&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; he said impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t know that I want anything. I could do with more, naturally.
      Who couldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More money. Not more beauty? Not a new purpose? Not something to live
      for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about, Sam. You&rsquo;re very strange
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly know myself,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s all confused, and I
      ought to have got things out of the tangle before I spoke to you. But I
      thought you might have seen and so be able to help me out. No: that&rsquo;s all
      right, Ada,&rdquo; he went on as she glared at him indignantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m blaming no
      one but myself. It&rsquo;s my responsibility. You don&rsquo;t see it yet, and I must
      make you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If a thing&rsquo;s there, I can see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We can both see that. It&rsquo;s only the cure for
      it that isn&rsquo;t plain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The failure of our marriage, if I must put it into words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Failure! But we <i>are</i> married. What do you mean?&rdquo; What Ada meant was
      that the ring was on her finger and the marriage certificate in her desk.
      Failure in marriage, if it meant anything to her, meant failure to get
      married, a broken engagement, and since their engagement had not been
      broken, since they had been formally and legally married in church, there
      could be no failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t exult in marriage,&rdquo; he tried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exult? I&rsquo;m sure I was the proudest woman in the parish the day I married
      you.&rdquo; It was true. &ldquo;But afterwards, afterwards!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;are you throwing it in my teeth that I didn&rsquo;t have a
      baby? Was that my fault?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. But it might have saved us, all the same, and when the baby did
      not come we made no effort to save ourselves. There&rsquo;s a light somewhere in
      every one of us and you and I have quenched our lights. They may be small,
      they may not be a great light like your father&rsquo;s, or... or the light which
      I have seen in the country, they may be nothing but a feeble glow, and we
      can only give our best. You and I have not given ours. We have not tried
      to find our light, but now&mdash;now that we have discovered what has been
      wrong with us all this while&mdash;we can try, and together. We can all of
      us give something to the world, not children in our case, but the
      something else which we were made to give. We don&rsquo;t know what it is that
      you can give and I can give, and we&rsquo;ve left it late to begin to find out,
      but it is not too late, is it, Ada? Ada,&rdquo; he pleaded, &ldquo;it is not too
      late?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the clock. &ldquo;If you want to wash your hands before dinner
      you&rsquo;d better do it now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;or you will be late.&rdquo; She rose, but
      before she left him, she had a moment of illumination. She thought she saw
      what he was driving at, that he must have seen some happy family while he
      was away and came back with the cry of the child less man on his lips. &ldquo;I
      suppose this means,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you want me to adopt a child. That&rsquo;s
      what you mean by giving. Well, I won&rsquo;t do it, Sam. I&rsquo;ve something else to
      do with my time than to look after another woman&rsquo;s brat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you to do?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What is it that you want to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To eat my dinner,&rdquo; she said. She had a healthy appetite. Perhaps that was
      why she wanted nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood by the door when she had gone, and his hand strayed to his pocket
      as though it sought a talisman. He felt the letter crinkle, then tore his
      hand away. Ada was work for a man. There wasn&rsquo;t room for Ada and for
      politics. &ldquo;Deeply regret private reasons compel total withdrawal from
      politics.&rdquo; Yes, that was the wording of the telegram which he would send:
      it was best to be thorough, and, plainly, the man who had Ada in hand had
      no time to spare on a hobby or an ambition or whatever it was that
      politics represented for him. He had other work to do in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stamped upon the ruins of a hope which came to birth ten years ago, and
      which he had carried with him in his heart of hearts and, as the letter in
      his pocket proved, not a fool&rsquo;s hope either. Yes, he had loved that hope
      which was born on his honeymoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to him that in all he had said, or tried to say, to Ada he had
      not mentioned love. It had not seemed the right word for use in a
      conversation with Ada, but, he reflected savagely, he had loved his hope
      of politics from the time of the honeymoon onwards: and from that time he
      had not loved Ada.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was that true? Had he neglected the substance for the shadow, used love
      upon his hope and not upon his wife? If he had his talk with her again,
      could he honestly begin it in another way? Could he begin with love? He
      knew that he could not, and squared his shoulders to the fact. It was a
      case, then, for the more courage. What was it Effie had said? &ldquo;There are
      no limits to bravery.&rdquo; He wondered, but he meant to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Satan&rsquo;s smile had faded. There is more joy amongst the devils over one
      sinner who back-slideth.... But not this time, Mephistopheles! Effie was
      winning still.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII&mdash;THE OLD CAMPAIGNER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>FFIE and Sam knew
      that they ought to be happy in the weeks which followed, because to be
      good is, theoretically, to be happy: but they were not happy. Sam, indeed,
      was less unhappy than Effie because he had sunk into one of those leaden,
      numbed moods of his which he knew of old as the stage preliminary to his
      brightest inspirations, and he could wait resignedly if not happily for
      the inspiration to emerge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Decidedly, he thought, he needed inspiration, He had to discover Ada, to
      search for her reality, and, having found it, to drag it out and set it in
      the forefront of her being. A big task: one whose success he must not
      jeopardize again by rushing at her prematurely without distinct plan. He
      had only made her suspicious of him by his first impulsive attempt, and
      time must undo the mischief before a return to the attack was either
      discreet or opportune.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited, but he did not savour life. When he had quickened Ada, life
      would, no doubt, be worth the living, but, meantime, it dragged. He told
      himself that he was too young yet at this new business of giving to feel
      the joy of it. Certainly, he was not joyful, but he was resolute. There
      was a grim tightening of the lips and a dogged look in the eyes which
      proclaimed that this was Samuel, the son of Anne. In this mood he could
      eat Dead Sea apples and feel they were a proper diet. Politics had gone,
      and with them any interest in the Council. And he did not know what to do
      about his business. He wanted to ask Effie, and Effie was not there to be
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not that she did not want to be there or that she did not suffer
      for her absence. Effie was not numb, and she suffered keenly, but she
      thought her absence strengthened Sam. When he came down from Hartle Pike
      with his resolution formed she took it that her scheme, as she had planned
      it, was complete and that she could forget her weak concession to return
      to the office. She was to be there in spirit, and spirit is strong though
      flesh is weak. Effie at the office in the flesh would have wanted to hug
      Sam and to kiss him, things which it is unbefitting to do in
      well-conducted offices. And, of course, she suffered. She had always known
      that she would suffer, but not that it would be as bad as this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The office was a temptation every day: to go there was to be with him, it
      was to find alleviation for her fever, it was to be at peace: but it was
      also to fling away hard-won success, and she resisted. That resistance
      engrossed her. It was all that she was capable of doing; it demanded all
      her strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      The obvious, the practical thing, if she was not to go to Sam&rsquo;s office,
      was to go to someone else&rsquo;s, to work, both as an antidote and as a means
      of livelihood, and she could not rouse herself to do it. She pawned some
      of the jewellery which remained to her, memorials of her father&rsquo;s lavish
      past, sent the weekly dole to her mother and lived upon the rest. She had
      sunk to this, Effie the crusader, Effie the advocate of courage! With
      Mélisande, she told herself she was not happy. She was not happy, she was
      not well, and she wanted, wanted Sam. She stayed at home lest she should
      go to him and ruin all that she had done. It could not last and she knew
      it could not last, but neither did she see the end of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then began the game of consequences: the moves of two pieces, one a pawn,
      the other the knight called Dubby Stewart.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a frumpish world, a world where the Frumps, of one or other sex or
      of neither sex, in one or other of their manifestations, have a great deal
      to do with the ordering of things. That is why it is politic, for one&rsquo;s
      ease, never to ignore the Frumps and never, never to challenge them by an
      act of gallant defiance such as shying an imitation wedding ring into the
      waters of Blea Tarn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie held, of course, that since she was in any case defying the Frumps
      it was honest to defy them in form as well as in substance, but it is only
      certain kinds of honesty which are the best policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frump who sat behind Effie at meals at the Inn (her name was Miss
      Entwistle) had doubted the genuineness of that ring, and when it
      disappeared her doubts went with it. The hussy, she saw, had realized that
      her ring deceived nobody, and was brazening it out in the shameless way of
      hussies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Women are wicked, but men are only weak; so that, though Miss Entwistle
      faced Sam at dinner from the next table, it was some days before she could
      spare her attention from the back of the greater sinner and transfer it to
      the face of the lesser. She could stare to her heart&rsquo;s content; it did not
      matter to Sam, who had only eyes for Effie: and the stare of Miss
      Entwistle was very persistent indeed. It was rude, but it was also
      pensive. It seemed to be looking for something it could not find.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not place him and was annoyed because she felt certain she had
      seen him before. She got up early more than once to read the names on the
      morning&rsquo;s letters, but did not find one which she could associate with
      Sam, and came home to Manchester a disappointed woman. Her failure to
      identify him spoiled her holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all things come to her who waits, especially, as the world is made, to
      Frumps, and Miss Entwistle came by the knowledge she craved one afternoon
      when her friend Mrs. Grandage took her to Ada Branstone&rsquo;s &ldquo;At Home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two photographs of Sam in Ada&rsquo;s drawing-room were intended to sustain
      her reputation for perfect domesticity. She couldn&rsquo;t live without him; she
      drew her very breath from him when he was there, and from his photographs
      when he was not. And since one was full-face and the other profile, they
      supplied Miss Entwistle with reliable identification of the sinner of
      Marbeck.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was heavenly. Hers was the power and the glory of initiating a scandal,
      of exploding a bomb&mdash;which would certainly disturb the peace of quite
      a number of people, of figuring in a maelstrom of backbiting tea-parties
      as the one authentic eyewitness. It was irresistible, besides plain duty
      to her injured hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drop of gall in her brimming honey-pot was that she did not know Ada
      well enough to tell her the secret by herself, but must share the
      excitement of that first surprise with Mrs. Grandage. She whispered with
      her friend for some close-packed, hectic moments, and the two ladies
      stubbornly outstayed the rest of the callers.
    </p>
    <p>
      They told Ada with a wonderful tenderness, watching her the while as cats
      watch mice, and Ada did not disappoint them. She cast no doubt on Miss
      Entwistle&rsquo;s story; she did not tell her that she knew Sam was in London at
      the time because she had had letters from him. Though she had nothing in
      the world but her marriage, she made no effort to protect its reputation.
      She exhibited herself to them in all the fury of her jealous rage, so that
      naturally, seeing her instant belief in what they told her, the ladies
      formed their own conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not the first time,&rdquo; is what the eyes of Mrs. Grandage said, and
      the eyes of the spinster looked back at her sepulchrally and said, &ldquo;It
      never is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ada was married. She had the title of wife, and unfaithfulness on her part
      was as far removed from her imagination as from her opportunity. She was
      married to Sam; she was the woman in possession, with the title-deeds in
      her desk and the seal upon her finger, and this was flagrant outrage. It
      struck at the roots of her complacency, and complacency was life. Yet she
      hadn&rsquo;t the wits to confound these iconoclasts with one little uninventive
      lie. It needed only that to abash Miss Entwistle&mdash;men&rsquo;s faces are
      often alike, she knew perfectly well that he was in London: anything would
      have done, anything would have been better than this abject, immediate
      betrayal of her citadel. She struck her flag without firing a shot, and
      lapsed into a slough of inarticulate anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I do? What shall I do?&rdquo; she wailed as soon as she was able to
      speak coherently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Miss Entwistle, &ldquo;that, you poor dear, is your business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had announced the glad tidings, she had found a titillating pleasure
      in watching Ada&rsquo;s reception of them and now she was eager to be off, to
      spread the news, to be the first that ever burst into her friends&rsquo; 
      drawing-rooms with word of a glorious scandal. She pleaded another call
      and escaped to her orgy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make him pay for this,&rdquo; said Ada viciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; advised Mrs. Grandage, who had a husband of her own, &ldquo;I hope
      you will be tactful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tactful:&rdquo; blazed Ada. &ldquo;Tactful, when&mdash;oh! oh!&rdquo; She screamed her
      sense of Sam&rsquo;s enormity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but you know, men will be men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t men. It&rsquo;s Sam. After all I&rsquo;ve done for him! Oh!&rdquo; and this was a
      different &ldquo;oh&rdquo; from the others. It made Mrs. Grandage look up sharply.
      &ldquo;The beast! The beast! This explains it all. Ethel, that man came home to
      me and asked me to adopt his child. He had the face. Of course I didn&rsquo;t
      know it was his own he was speaking of, but I see it now. Ethel, what
      shall I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They seemed to Mrs. Grandage to be drifting into deeper waters than she
      had skill to swim in. &ldquo;I should take advice,&rdquo; she said, meaning nothing
      except that neither by advising nor anything else was she going to be
      entangled in this affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A solicitor&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked Ada, catching at the phrase. &ldquo;Yes. Naturally. Sam
      shall be made to pay to the uttermost farthing.&rdquo; Her idea of legal
      obligations were, perhaps, not vaguer than other people&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a solicitor&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grandage in despair. &ldquo;At least, my dear,
      not yet. Your father&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. My father made me marry Sam. He brought Sam home and threw him at
      me. I will go to my father. Of course, in any case, I can&rsquo;t stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grandage made a last rally for wordly-wisdom. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you bring
      yourself to see your husband first?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See him!&rdquo; said Ada heroically. &ldquo;I will never see him again as long as I
      live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The visitor buttoned her glove. After all, if Ada chose to make a fool of
      herself it was no business of hers, and she had tried her best, if a
      resolutely non-committal attempt can be a best. She kissed Ada with real
      sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a great deal to undo this.&rdquo; And by &ldquo;this&rdquo;
       she did not mean the peccadillo of Sam Branstone, but the pruriency of
      Miss Entwistle. She was an experienced woman, and angry with herself for
      having listened to the temptress and for aiding and abetting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Grandage referred in after years to &ldquo;that woman,&rdquo; it was
      understood that she was thinking of Miss Entwistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ada saw her to the door, and went straight to the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate,&rdquo; she said to her cook, &ldquo;Mr. Branstone has disgraced himself, he&rsquo;s
      been unfaithful. I am going to my father&rsquo;s. Please tell him that I know
      everything and that I shall not return.&rdquo; She had no reticence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, mum,&rdquo; said the Capable cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result was that when Sam went into the drawing-room that night, he
      found Anne Branstone sitting there, darning his socks, and perhaps it was
      because she was happy that she did not look a day older than when he saw
      her last; perhaps charring suited her; or perhaps living for an idea had
      kept her young. The idea was that, some day, Sam would need her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn&rsquo;t a miracle: there was nothing more wonderful about it than the
      fact that Anne was a very good friend of the cook, Kate Earwalker: but Sam
      stood gaping helplessly. In his own house, at his age, and after all these
      years he stood before his mother, the intruder, like a schoolboy who knows
      himself at fault. She lacked nothing of the old ascendancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re nobbut happy when you&rsquo;ve got folks talking of
      you. But you don&rsquo;t look thriving on it, neither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you that will tell me that,&rdquo; said Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Ada?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone to her father&rsquo;s, and none coming back, she says. Says you&rsquo;re
      unfaithful and told Kate she knows everything. What is it, Sam? What&rsquo;s
      everything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who brought you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate did,&rdquo; said Anne calmly. &ldquo;Why, Sam, did you think I&rsquo;ve lived with
      nothing better than what George Chappie and the papers told me of you? I&rsquo;d
      a fancy for the truth, and it&rsquo;s not a thing to get from men. Kate&rsquo;s been a
      spy, like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has, and you&rsquo;ll bear no grudge for that. You&rsquo;d have lived in a
      pig-sty and fed like a pig if I&rsquo;d none sent Kate to do for you, but I&rsquo;ve
      come myself this time. It looks summat beyond Kate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s happened? What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know better than me what it is. You&rsquo;ve got folks talking of you and
      they&rsquo;ve talked to Ada. Unfaithful, she told Kate, and she&rsquo;s gone home to
      Peter&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must come back,&rdquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why?&rdquo; asked Anne. &ldquo;Because folk talk? To stop their mouths?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Because I want her here. They&rsquo;re talking, are they? Well, they can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne looked at him. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t care if they do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you a politician?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, politics!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo; It had, and, as he saw thankfully,
      at the right time. He tried to imagine how differently this would have
      affected him if it had come in the midst of the Sandyford election.
      Electors postulate respectability in a candidate. But that had gone, and
      gossip did not matter now. The real things mattered. Ada mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had a move on, then,&rdquo; she said, and neither her look nor tone
      suggested that she found the move displeasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay,&rdquo; he said carelessly. &ldquo;But Ada must come back. I&rsquo;ve got to get
      her back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happen she&rsquo;ll come and happen she won&rsquo;t, and I&rsquo;d have a better chance of
      knowing which if you&rsquo;d told me what&rsquo;s upset her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Unfaithful? Yes, it&rsquo;s true. I&rsquo;ve been
      unfaithful for ten years. I&rsquo;ve never been faithful and I&rsquo;ve never been
      fair. I&rsquo;ve thought of the business and politics when I ought to have been
      thinking of her. I worked at them and I didn&rsquo;t work at Ada. Don&rsquo;t blame
      Ada, mother. I&rsquo;ll not have that. You never liked her, and you prophesied a
      failure. It&rsquo;s been a failure, but I made it one; I let it drift when I
      ought to have taken hold. But it isn&rsquo;t going to be a failure now. I&rsquo;ve
      given up the other things and I&rsquo;ve come back to my job, the job I
      neglected, the job I did not see was there at all until&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He
      paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till what?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till Effie showed it me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Effie?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Oh! Then there&rsquo;s something in their talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something? There&rsquo;s everything, and everything that&rsquo;s wrong-headed and
      abominable. That&rsquo;s where this hurts me, mother. They&rsquo;ll be saying wrong
      things of her, of Effie.&rdquo; He began to see that gossip mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would be the right things to say?&rdquo; asked Anne dryly. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Effie?
      And do you mean her when you say you&rsquo;ve been unfaithful for ten years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant what I said. That I&rsquo;ve put other things in front of Ada.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Including Effie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Effie&rsquo;s a ray from heaven,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, aye,&rdquo; said Anne sceptically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, mother, you&rsquo;re not going to misunderstand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if you can make me understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can try,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the chances are that I shall fail. The only
      thing that will make you understand Effie is to see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try the-other ways first,&rdquo; said Anne grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She made me see. She gave me everything. She gave me herself. I found
      myself because of her and I&rsquo;m only living in the light she gave me.&rdquo; It
      was difficult to find words for what Effie was and meant to him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      know if I can ever explain,&rdquo; he faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on. You&rsquo;re doing very well.&rdquo; He was&mdash;Anne&rsquo;s insight helping her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like rebirth. It&rsquo;s as if I&rsquo;d lived till I met her six months ago
      with crooked eyesight. I didn&rsquo;t see straight, and then, mother&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       He hesitated as a man will hesitate before voicing a profound conviction,
      afraid lest he be thought absurd. &ldquo;Then I found salvation, I&rsquo;ve been a
      taker and we&rsquo;re here to give. I took from you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave that,&rdquo; said Anne curtly. &ldquo;I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It seems to me that I knew nothing till Effie
      come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you want Ada back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time I gave to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Effie show you that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne was silent for a minute. Then: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a look at Effie,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;You can take me to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not to meet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pondered it, and him. &ldquo;Kate told me you were looking ill,&rdquo; she said
      with apparent inconsequence. &ldquo;Well, if you can&rsquo;t take me to Effie, I must
      go alone. I&rsquo;m going, either road. Give me her address and I&rsquo;ll go
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wrote it down. &ldquo;Effie Mannering,&rdquo; she read. &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; she said grimly,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give that young woman a piece of my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he said, alarmed, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll not be rude to her! You&rsquo;ve not
      misunderstood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think so. I think I understand that
      you&rsquo;ve got your silly heads up in the clouds and it&rsquo;ll do the pair of you
      a lot of good to have them brought to earth. I&rsquo;ll know for sure when I&rsquo;ve
      set eyes on her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see the glory of her, then,&rdquo; he said defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;If you ask me, Sam, there&rsquo;s been a sight too much
      glorification about this business. It shapes to me,&rdquo; she went on,
      thwarting the protest which was leaping to his lips. &ldquo;It shapes to me like
      a plain case of love. Aye, and love&rsquo;s too rare a thing in this world to be
      thrown away. I was never one to waste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Anne Branstone took control, and Sam sat staring at her helplessly like
      a man who dreams.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII&mdash;THE KNIGHT&rsquo;S MOVE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T might very well
      have occurred to Sam to retort that he and Effle had not &ldquo;their silly
      heads in the clouds&rdquo; any more fantastically than had Anne her self when
      she retreated to Madge&rsquo;s and watched her loved son only through the eyes
      of Kate Earwalker. But it did not occur to him and, if it had, Effie at
      least would have disproved the retort. Effle outstripped them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth was that as soon as Effle knew what was the matter with her she
      was not appalled, dismayed, ashamed, or any of the things appropriate to a
      young lady in her situation, but simply and purely exultant. Unhappiness
      fell from her like a cloak, and left her radiant with joy. And she had
      called herself a realist!
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a realist; she was engrossed with fact, not with the
      circumstantial detail of her fact. She hardly wanted Sam now, she had him,
      she was miles and leagues from care, alone in a shining world with her
      transcendant fact. Courage returned in full flood to her and she brimmed
      with bravery and pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was out of work and must find work quickly which would pay her well.
      She was going to suffer, she was going (to put it mildly) to be
      misunderstood. What did it matter, what did anything matter in comparison
      with her exultant fact? She was going to be the mother of his child.
      Marbeck was not a dream; Marbeck was coming true, and the truth and the
      glory of it swept her to a heaven which only women know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps she was a trespasser within the gates, but they had opened to her
      and they would not close. She might be prosecuted for her trespass. Let
      them try! You cannot hurt invulnerability. She was a world within a world,
      self-satisfying, self-complete, not so much derisive of the other world as
      utterly forgetful of it. Her cloud of glory hid it from her eyes, and if
      she peeped at all through breaches in the cloud she saw people as one sees
      them on the road beneath a mountain-top, like crawling ants.
    </p>
    <p>
      A knock came at her door, and she looked bemused through a gap in the
      clouds into the eyes of Dubby Stewart, but it was not to look at the world
      which did not understand. It was to look at Dubby, who loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Dubby knew. It had not been difficult to know. She had refused him,
      she had let him see why, and Sam and Effie had been away from Manchester
      at the same time. It was not precise evidence, but he had written
      leaderettes on evidence not more exact and did not doubt the facts. They
      had kept him from her till now, but he could keep away no longer. And
      before he went into her room he knew all there was to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Effie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m welcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you are,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I ought to have written to you long ago.
      I&rsquo;ve been home weeks from my holiday.&rdquo; It was no use trying to see Dubby
      as a crawling ant, and she gave her hand in friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That breaks the ice,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there was ice to break.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he reminded her, &ldquo;I said I didn&rsquo;t love and run away, and I did
      more or less run away. I came one Sunday because I said I would, but I
      couldn&rsquo;t do it again. The trouble with me is that I ought to be a
      journalist, and after about twelve years of it I&rsquo;m still human.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dubby! I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Effie; I didn&rsquo;t come to bleat. That&rsquo;s only an apology for not
      coming before. And now I&rsquo;m here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have tea,&rdquo; she said quickly, going to the bell, but he caught her
      hand before she pulled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to put a table between us? Do, if you must&rdquo;&mdash;he released
      her hand&mdash;&ldquo;but I&rsquo;d hoped it would not come to that. Shall I ring the
      bell, Miss Mannering?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t punish me by calling names. Don&rsquo;t ring.&rdquo; She armed herself
      with courage, and turned to face him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. Really thanks, Effie. I know I&rsquo;m a bore, but if the old song has
      a good tune to it I don&rsquo;t see why I shouldn&rsquo;t sing twice. It <i>is</i> a
      good tune,&rdquo; he went on with a passion which belied his surface flippancy.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best I have in me, which mayn&rsquo;t be saying much, because I&rsquo;ve a
      rotten ear for music, but this tune&rsquo;s got me badly, like the diseases they
      play on the barrel-organs, and I can&rsquo;t lose it. I get up to it in the
      morning, and I go to bed to it at night, and it&rsquo;s ringing in my ears all
      day. Effie, I&rsquo;m not much of a cove and I&rsquo;ve flattered myself that
      sincerity departed from me when I cut my wisdom teeth. I tried to live up
      to that belief and it&rsquo;s only half come off. I&rsquo;ve tried to make a
      raree-show of life, to sit outside and watch the puppets play, and life&rsquo;s
      won. Life&rsquo;s got me down, and I&rsquo;m inside now. I&rsquo;m where you&rsquo;ve put me, and
      a good place too: I&rsquo;m near the radiator and it warms the cockles of my
      heart. But I never liked radiators. Mind you, I can do with them and I can
      be grateful for them. If a season ticket for life for a seat near the
      radiator is all that you can give me, I can keep a stiff upper lip and
      thank you for what I&rsquo;ve got. But I never had a passion for radiators, and
      I do like fires. There&rsquo;s life in a fire Must it be just the radiator, or
      can you make it hearth and home for us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dubby,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I told you before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. Nothing doing in second thoughts?&rdquo; She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I only got drunk last time. This time it will need the binge
      of my life. I&rsquo;d cherished hopes of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drunk,&rdquo; she said reproachfully. &ldquo;With a stiff upper lip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I dunno,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It takes a stiff upper lip to get me to the
      dentist&rsquo;s, but I make him use an anæsthetic all the same. Still, if you&rsquo;d
      rather I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it would be braver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right. But I&rsquo;d like to hit something. There&rsquo;s nobody you&rsquo;d like me to
      hit, is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure?&rdquo; he said. He had it well in mind that somebody ought to hit Sam.
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get back to where we were before I made a stump oration&mdash;to
      when I came in and you looked at me like a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I always shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. It&rsquo;s the privilege of a friend to be impertinent, and I&rsquo;m
      rather good at impertinence. You see, Effie old thing, you&rsquo;re supposed to
      be one of the world&rsquo;s workers, and you&rsquo;re not at the office to-day. You
      haven&rsquo;t been at the office for weeks. I know, because I gave Florrie half
      a crown.&rdquo; Florrie was the maid. &ldquo;And it isn&rsquo;t that you&rsquo;ve come into money,
      because Florrie tells me you&rsquo;ve been starving yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not.&rdquo; Effie was indignant. She had not starved herself. While all
      was dreary, food had certainly not attracted her, but neither had anything
      else; and she expected to take a lively interest in it now. &ldquo;Really I&rsquo;ve
      not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you say goes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And Florrie imagined it, but she didn&rsquo;t
      imagine the part about your not going to the office, and if anything&rsquo;s
      wrong there, don&rsquo;t forget that I know Branstone pretty well. I can talk to
      him like a father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong, anywhere,&rdquo; she said, and, indeed, things were not
      only not wrong but exuberantly right, only she could not tell him why.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure of that?&rdquo; he persisted. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing you can tell a pal?
      Nothing you can tell me, when you know I&rsquo;d walk through fire for you? Damn
      it, I can&rsquo;t pretend. I&rsquo;m not a friend. I&rsquo;m a man in love, and I ask you to
      be fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dubby,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t make things too hard for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it I who make them hard?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;oris it Sam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him amazed, and certainly Effie was stupid then, or, at
      least, too wrapped up in her great preoccupation to be alert. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t
      be petty,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t debit you with jealousy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? No? And yet I have a certain right to be jealous of him. I think you
      won&rsquo;t deny it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It wasn&rsquo;t what he said or even the deep bitterness of his tone, it was
      something in his eyes, like a hurt animal&rsquo;s, which made her quite
      suddenly, and as a thing apart from his words, see what had happened. But
      she did not see even now the whole of Dubby&rsquo;s love and the beauty of his
      knightly move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Dubby, you knew when you spoke just now. You knew
      that Sam and I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you I had a word with Florrie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Florrie?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;What could Florrie tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that she knew she told. Guessing is another of the
      things I&rsquo;m good at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw it then, to what perceptiveness his love had brought him, to what
      high action. It had sped her cloud and she saw, clear-eyed as he, his
      fine, impeccable fidelity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! And I called you petty! I told you you were jealous. Dubby, I didn&rsquo;t
      know. You&rsquo;d have done that for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; he apologized, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in love with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we order love? Why does it come all wrong?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t come so wrong but I can put it right for you,&rdquo; he said, making
      his offer again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? I didn&rsquo;t mean myself,&rdquo; she said, wondering. &ldquo;Love&rsquo;s not come wrong to
      me. It&rsquo;s you I&rsquo;m thinking of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is it right for you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;Terrifically.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it? When Sam has not been near you in weeks?&rdquo; It was wedged in his
      mind that Sam was playing the villain. &ldquo;When you are here alone, do you
      see him, Effie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s all so right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head, perplexed. &ldquo;It may be good metaphysics, but it sounds
      bad sense. I&rsquo;ll be quite honest with you. I&rsquo;m suffering pretty badly from
      suppressed desire to horsewhip Sam Branstone. I think he deserves it, I
      know I&rsquo;d enjoy it and I think you&rsquo;re trying to head me off it. I daresay
      it&rsquo;s primitive of me, but it will do me good and I don&rsquo;t mind telling you
      I need good doing to me. Effie, mayn&rsquo;t I go and horsewhip Sam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If anybody&rsquo;s going to horsewhip Sam,&rdquo; said a voice, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s me. I&rsquo;m in
      charge of this job, not you, my lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had not seen Anne come in. They saw her now, a little old woman of
      the working class in her best clothes, with a bugled cape and cotton
      gloves, elastic-sided boots and a quaint bonnet tied with ribbon beneath
      her chin, and, unaccountably, she filled the room. They would have passed
      her in the street without a second glance as one of the throng, at face
      value insignificant; but this was not Anne in the street. It was Anne in
      arms for Sam, and when Effie and Stewart compared notes afterwards they
      each confessed to having had the same thought: that their eyes were
      traitors and that what they saw was fantasy and what they felt was real.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sam&rsquo;s mother,&rdquo; she introduced herself, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s like enough I were
      overfond of him when he was a lad and didn&rsquo;t thrash enough, but I&rsquo;m not
      too old to start again. You&rsquo;ll be Effie? Aye, I&rsquo;ve come round here to put
      things in their places. They&rsquo;ve got a bit askew amongst the lot of you,
      and what I heard when I came in won&rsquo;t help.&rdquo; She looked accusingly at
      Dubby. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be her brother, I reckon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to him the best way out. Anne had come to &ldquo;put things in their
      places,&rdquo; and she reckoned he was Effie&rsquo;s brother, which, now he thought of
      it, was exactly his place. Brotherhood was thrust upon him, but he thought
      he had achieved it. Plainly, for all Effie&rsquo;s enigmas, there was nothing
      else for him, and he let Anne put him in his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, without a glance at Effie, &ldquo;her brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a clean-limbed family,&rdquo; she complimented them, and Dubby stole a
      look at Effie, half humorous and half defying her to contradict his
      brotherhood. &ldquo;Well, I came to see Effie, but I&rsquo;ll none gainsay that her
      brother has a right to stay and listen, if he&rsquo;ll listen quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dubby, still challenging Effie, &ldquo;her brother has a right.&rdquo; And
      Effie did not deny him. She had her courage, but the unexpectedness of
      Anne and the force of her, as if for all these years she had been winding
      up her will, which now came into play like a spring immensely braced in
      super-tightened coils, caused her to want an ally and she agreed that
      Dubby had a right if not the one conferred on him by Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit, Mrs. Branstone?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was wondering when I should hear your voice,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a
      talker, lass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Effie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More of a doer.&rdquo; Effie was wondering whether that was praise or
      condemnation, when Anne added: &ldquo;I like you the better for that, though
      it&rsquo;s a good voice. I haven&rsquo;t heard it much, but I&rsquo;ve heard it. I haven&rsquo;t
      seen you much, but I&rsquo;ve seen enough. I&rsquo;m on your side, Effie.&rdquo; She
      astonished them both by rising as if to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Dubby, &ldquo;is that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne looked with humorous sympathy at Effie. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s men all over, isn&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re fond of calling women talkers, but a man&rsquo;s not
      happy till a thing&rsquo;s been put in words. Me and your sister understand each
      other now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite certain that I do,&rdquo; said Effie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, maybe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; conceded Anne. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fact that I told Sam
      last night I was coming round here to give you a piece of my mind, and I
      don&rsquo;t notice that I&rsquo;m doing it. The need seemed to go when I set eyes on
      you, and I&rsquo;m pretty full of a thing I want to do, only I&rsquo;ve not quite got
      the face to ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Mrs. Branstone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to kiss you, lass,&rdquo; said Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dubby Stewart had for the second time that day the impression that women
      talked, so to speak, in hieroglyphics.... There seemed to be a kind of
      feminine shorthand to which only women held the key, and he did not
      understand the sudden softening of Ellie&rsquo;s face nor her quick response.
      And he did not know why, when Anne kissed her, Effie said, &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; nor
      why Anne said, &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t no. It&rsquo;s yes.&rdquo; A kiss, it seemed, had various
      meanings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne in effect had conveyed to Effie that she thanked her and, more, she
      honoured her. Effie denied that she merited honour and Anne maintained
      that she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s had two dips in the lucky-bag and he&rsquo;s drawn a
      prize this time. It&rsquo;s more than any man deserves, but we&rsquo;ll not grudge it
      Sam, will we, Effie?&rdquo; And to Dubby the thing took on a fresh aspect of
      bewilderment. If that meant anything, it meant that Anne was welcoming a
      daughter. Didn&rsquo;t the woman know that Sam was married?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve grudged him nothing,&rdquo; Effie said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne meditated that, then looked at Effie with a touch of what was, for
      her, shyness. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve grudged him nothing,&rdquo; she disagreed, &ldquo;except your
      pride in giving up. And you can do it, you can give up, but Sam&rsquo;s nobbut a
      man, and they&rsquo;re a weak flesh, men. He looks the shadow of himself,&rdquo; she
      exaggerated resolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he?&rdquo; said Effie anxiously, and Anne nodded a sombre face. &ldquo;What do
      you want me to do, Mrs. Branstone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to give up giving up. Sam said a thing to me last night. He
      said you&rsquo;d make him find salvation. Well, happen; but what&rsquo;s certain sure
      is that you made him find love. He&rsquo;s found it, lass, and he mustn&rsquo;t lose
      it, and he will if you leave things where they are. He&rsquo;s trying to do a
      thing that isn&rsquo;t, possible. He&rsquo;s trying to live aside of Ada, loving you.
      He&rsquo;ll try to love her for the love of you, and kiss her, telling himself
      he&rsquo;s kissing you, and it will not be you; and the love he tries to bring
      her will turn to loathing in his heart. And what&rsquo;ll happen then, when love
      goes sour within him? Eh, lass, you took yon lad to heaven and you&rsquo;re
      sending him to hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not fair to Stewart. It was hardly bearable: he was not her brother
      and he hadn&rsquo;t the feelings of a brother. He saw great happiness in Effie&rsquo;s
      face, as if two happinesses mingled there, the one of giving up her dream,
      the other of awakening to a sweet reality. He saw her put out a hand
      towards Anne, surrendering, consenting, giving all in one swift, heady
      leap from cloud to earth, and then he saw her sway, and caught her in time
      to break her fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne eyed him sharply. &ldquo;Have you heard of your sister&rsquo;s fainting before,
      lately?&rdquo; she asked, busy on her knees with Effie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Florrie told me. Twice. Can I do anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring her round,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;But you can do something. You can go
      to Sam at his office and tell him he&rsquo;s wanted here. Tell him I want him,
      and there&rsquo;s news for him. Send Florrie up as you go, and you needn&rsquo;t take
      that horsewhip with you, neither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I needn&rsquo;t take it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Dubby, Effie&rsquo;s brother, went out on an embassy for Anne. &ldquo;Feeling it?
      Feeling?&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;you God-abandoned devil, what right have you to
      feel? A journalist. A looker-on. There&rsquo;s a story in this for you. There&rsquo;s
      the guts of a story given away to you with a cup of tea... on, no, we
      didn&rsquo;t have the tea; given neat, and you can&rsquo;t be decently grateful.
      What&rsquo;s the title? &lsquo;The Charwoman&rsquo;s Son&rsquo;? No, damned if it is. Something
      about brother. Brother! Yes, you blighter, brother... brother, and proud
      of it. &lsquo;Pride of Kin.&rsquo; That&rsquo;ll do, and God help me to live up to it.&rdquo; He
      turned into Sam&rsquo;s office and delivered his message in a cold, unemotional
      voice. It seemed that Effie, brave herself, was the cause of bravery in
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Effie! My mother! What have you to do with them?&rdquo; asked Sam, amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given you a message,&rdquo; said the taciturn herald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s behind it, Dubby? Is Effie ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stewart was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she&mdash;dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dubby was tempted to say he didn&rsquo;t know. It; seemed to him that things
      went too happily with Branstone, that it was fit, if only for the twenty
      minutes which it would take for him to reach Busholme, to let Sam think
      that Effie might be dead, to let him taste the flavour of torture. Dubby
      suffered and would suffer, not for twenty minutes but, he gloomily
      anticipated, for a lifetime. Let Sam have his minutes of it! Then he
      remembered he was Effie&rsquo;s brother, and before Sam had his hat and coat on,
      malice had left him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s neither ill
      nor dead. They&rsquo;ve got good news for you.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV&mdash;THE NEW BOOK OF MARTYRS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>F there was news
      which Anne must send posthaste to hid him come to hear, and if Effie was
      neither ill nor dead, he need not overtax his wits to guess it. Yet he had
      never thought of this very natural sequel to the Marbeck week, and the
      plain fact is that he did not much want to think of it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like your Effie,&rdquo; Anne told him. &ldquo;I like her very well. She&rsquo;s going to
      make a grandmother of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thought his mother had never been fatuous before: she thought he took
      the news morosely, and perhaps her expectation had been too high. She
      assumed that a child was the first consideration of a man&rsquo;s life; which is
      not true, even, of all women and true of only a minority of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was Sam, in fact, morose. He had never been more intensely and
      silently alive. In itself, this thing was right with a shining exultant
      rightness which warmed him to the marrow. It crowned and completed Marbeck
      and it crowned and completed him. He who was childless was to be a father,
      and by Effie! He had nothing but a thankful emotion for that, and looked
      with yearning eyes at Effie, giver of all else, who was now to give him
      this. He had not known her wonder could increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw that more was expected of him than that he should look at her
      adoringly. Anne was on tip-toe with anticipation. Her difficulty, if
      indeed she had acknowledged to herself that there was any, had been to
      make these visionaries see that love mattered and that Ada did not; and
      her success with Effie had been complete. She had never doubted of success
      with Sam, the weaker vessel, for there was love, sufficient in itself; and
      there was now the added argument of Effie&rsquo;s child. She could not see that
      he had any choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood there conscious of the expectancy of their regard, and knew that
      he was failing them. He thought they took a blinkered view, seeing the
      child and nothing else. To them, apparently, the child came first: they
      were hypnotized by what was, really, an afterthought, and there was the
      greater need for him to keep a steadfast eye upon the truth. As he saw it,
      the truth was that he had put his hand to another plough; on Hartle Pike
      he had lighted such a candle by Effie&rsquo;s grace as he trusted would never be
      put out; and he had gone to Ada. True, Ada had gone from him, but that was
      temporary and trivial, whereas here was a real distraction and he saw two
      loyalties before him&mdash;to Effie and the idea, and to Effie and her
      child. It seemed to Sam that the first was the greater of these two.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had wrestled with an afterthought before, one which hardly yielded in
      temptation to that which now confronted him, and he had thrown it. He had
      refused to contest Sandyford because there was not room for politics in a
      scheme which included Ada, and still less was there room for Effie. He
      felt faint with discouragement at the thought that Effie, unless
      appearance belied her, had capitulated to her afterthought, but he stood
      firmly by their treaty. They had decided that duty came first; he had
      shouldered duty; and he, at any rate, had no room for afterthoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was loyal to Effie and the Marbeck pact, duty&rsquo;s bondsman, Ada&rsquo;s
      husband. He made a gesture of decision, which Anne misinterpreted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; she said a little smugly, &ldquo;this settles it all right. It wasn&rsquo;t
      common sense in you to part before, but I reckon there&rsquo;ll be no parting
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Effie softly, &ldquo;not now.&rdquo; She stole a look of shy, glad
      confidence at Sam, and he found it extraordinarily difficult to meet her
      eye, and still more difficult to say what he must, at any cost, get said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure,&rdquo; he said at last, wishing the earth would swallow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment he would cheerfully have given a hand to escape having to
      differ from them. They were Effie and his mother: they were his mother and
      Effie: the two women to whom he owed everything: more, he loved Effie so
      that every fibre in him yearned for her, and, even more than that, he was
      delicately sensitive to Effie in her present case. But it couldn&rsquo;t change
      him. His loyalty was engaged, to fanaticism, to another Effie, high Effie
      of the hills, of the crusade and the idea; and this seemed to him somehow,
      a lower Effie, an Effie who had dipped the flag of her ideal to a coming
      baby, whilst he was faithful to the old unbending Effie who had thrown an
      imitation wedding ring away. It almost seemed as if she wanted that ring
      back, base metal though it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      A case, perhaps, of splitting hairs, but, at any rate, the case of a man
      with a faith at one extreme and at the other his miserable conviction that
      happiness was not for him. He had abandoned happiness when he left
      Marbeck, and lived now in a place where happiness was barred by Ada.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure,&rdquo; he repeated drearily. &ldquo;You see, there&rsquo;s Ada and I have
      to be fair to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ada&rsquo;s left you,&rdquo; snapped Anne. A contentious Sam was not going to find
      her amiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      He chose to put it in another way. &ldquo;My wife,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is staying at
      present with her father. Yes, mother,&rdquo; he went on firmly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be
      fair to Ada and I&rsquo;ve to guard against unfairness all the more because you
      won&rsquo;t be fair. You won&rsquo;t be ordinarily just. You always hated Ada.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she agreed viciously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a clean woman. I always hated vermin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam turned to Effle immensely heartened by this virulence. &ldquo;You see!&rdquo; he
      appealed, calling to witness the hopeless bias of his mother. It was, he
      wished to imply, this blind hatred of Anne for Ada which accounted for his
      mother&rsquo;s attitude, her exalting of&mdash;well&mdash;the mistress over the
      wife, her flagrant unmorality. He tried to put all this into his gesture.
      &ldquo;And you,&rdquo; he reinforced it, &ldquo;you sent me to her, Effie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bowed her head, admitting it, but Anne was not prepared to let it go
      at that. &ldquo;Even Effie,&rdquo; she said &ldquo;can make a mistake. She would not send
      you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, looking at Effie, he saw that it was true. He had seen it from the
      first and it bothered him profoundly. Effie had changed: there was, in all
      they said, this noticeable stressing of the &ldquo;now,&rdquo; to differentiate them
      from the &ldquo;then.&rdquo; What was it? Anne&rsquo;s arguments, or the baby, or had Effie,
      uninfluenced by either, really changed her mind about the Marbeck treaty?
      he couldn&rsquo;t believe that last. Marbeck was infallible and he was dogged in
      the faith. He responded to the Marbeck creed like the needle of a compass
      to the meridian, and if with this needle also there was deflection it was
      corrected by his racial stubbornness. He had his people&rsquo;s queer,
      infatuated pride in the contemplation of their own tenacity, even when,
      perhaps mostly when, it hurts to be tenacious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas Effie had known ever since Dubby Stewart brought her back from
      cloud-land that Marbeck was very fallible indeed, or, rather, Marbeck was
      one thing and living up to Marbeck was another. If he had said, instead of
      only thinking, that she was a lower Effie now, she would not have
      contradicted him, though she did not want a wedding ring of either metal.
      She wanted Sam. She was changed from the idealist who thought she could be
      happy as a sign-post and a spiritual guide. She had come down to Mother
      Earth where men and women live. At Marbeck they were on an altitude where
      the air was too rarefied for human lungs, and she wanted to fall with Sam
      from selflessness to mere humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she agreed again with Anne, &ldquo;I should not send you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have to think this out,&rdquo; he said. Effie admitted to being
      earthly, and he was horribly dismayed! &ldquo;Effie,&rdquo; he cried in pain, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
      you see?&rdquo; he wanted desperately to be understood by her, if not by Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she said, and not without pride either. Whatever was fine in him,
      whatever reacted from an Eflie come to earth, was due to her, and she was
      proud of him even when, as now, he used her tempered steel against her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne watched with a grim appreciation his anxiety to make a pikestaff
      plain. &ldquo;We all see,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re none so deep and we&rsquo;re none so daft
      as all that. You&rsquo;ve got a maggot in your brain, and I know the shape of
      it. I&rsquo;ve had the same in mine, and if you&rsquo;ll think back ten years, you&rsquo;ll
      know what I mean. We&rsquo;re the same breed, Sam, and we can both do silly
      things and stand by then and suffer for them. I flitted from you to Madge,
      and I didn&rsquo;t set eyes on you from that day till last night. That&rsquo;s what I
      mean by suffering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And there, in those few words, the tragedy of ten years stood confessed.
      Parted from Sam, she lived in exile, suffering, and, of course, he had
      known it and deliberately forgot it, so that the point of her revelation
      was not its truth, but the amazing fact that she should speak of it at
      all. Anne had the pride which suffers silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; he said, distressed for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, none of that,&rdquo; she bade him harshly. &ldquo;If I were soft enough to let
      it hurt me, that&rsquo;s my look out. But here&rsquo;s the point, Sam. There&rsquo;s another
      woman soft about you, too, and she&rsquo;s not the same as me. I&rsquo;d had you since
      I bore you, and I were not young when you and me came to a parting; but
      she&rsquo;s young, and you&rsquo;ll none make Eflie suffer the road I suffered while
      there&rsquo;s strength in me to say you nay. I&rsquo;d have gone to my grave without
      your knowing this if it hadn&rsquo;t been for Effie. It&rsquo;s not good for a man to
      know too much. They&rsquo;re easy stuffed with pride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pretended, with deep magnanimity, to think that he had not known until
      she told him, but they both knew very well that he had always known. She
      dwelt deliberately on it now to inform him, not of her suffering, but of
      the intensity of her feeling for Effie. It was so intense that she could
      speak of her own suffering: for Effie&rsquo;s sake she had unveiled, thrown off
      her stoicism, and flung the spoken truth as a challenge and a revelation
      at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew what speaking in this manner cost her, but he was stubborn still
      in relating all she said to her ungovernable hate of Ada; whereas Anne did
      not hate Ada ungovernably, but only when Ada hurt Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he said &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; and got no further with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m your mother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and you can stop thinking of me now
      and think of Effie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Anne impatiently. She hadn&rsquo;t imagined an obstinacy which
      would not yield to what she had said. Surely he knew the sacrifice of
      pride she made in saying it! And there was Effie, too, who said little and
      looked the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he despaired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then others must know for you,&rdquo; said Anne, and when his lips only
      tightened at that, &ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;surely you&rsquo;ll never go against the
      pair of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But there were two Effies, and he wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;going against&rdquo; them both, while
      he held Anne to be mesmerized by hate of Ada. For all that, it desolated
      him to be in opposition to them now, to Anne and Effie, the women who
      counted, the women who gave. &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; he had to say, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s Ada.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said it, as he hoped to say it, finally. He wanted to get away from
      these two, to escape from their distracting presence to a place where he
      could think. After all, Hartle Pike had not settled his problem, and he
      must try somewhere else&mdash;Platt Fields, perhaps. They had a sort of
      space.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he could not escape&mdash;not, at least, till Anne had played her ace.
      Anne had not finished yet, though she had hoped ten years in the
      wilderness had been enough. It seemed that they were not, and she must
      wander still. Well, she could do what she must.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, aye,&rdquo; she said dryly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s Ada. There&rsquo;s your bad ha&rsquo;penny, and I
      reckon summat&rsquo;ll have to be done with her. But if you&rsquo;ll stop worrying,
      lad, and if worst comes to the worst, I&rsquo;ll take Ada on myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Effie started towards her. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hold your hush,&rdquo; said Anne. This was Anne&rsquo;s game, not Effie&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam was still staring at her. &ldquo;You!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see you and Effie happy, and I dunno as owt else matters.&rdquo; It did
      not matter what the cost was to Anne. &ldquo;When you used to come home to your
      tea from Mr. Travers&rsquo; office, what you left was always good enough for me,
      and I can stomach your leavings still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It startled Effie, who had thought herself a specialist in sacrifice. This
      was the very ferocity of self-denial.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, tired and overstrained, Effie had found peace in resigning the
      leadership to Anne, but here was a lead she could not follow. It was not
      that she mistook Anne&rsquo;s purpose or doubted her capacity. Her faith in Anne
      was young but adamantine, and she knew that if Anne replaced Sam with Ada,
      and made herself heir to the Marbeck plan, she would unquestionably do for
      Ada what Sam had undertaken to do. But the thing was simply not good
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mrs. Branstone, no,&rdquo; she said firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get oft&rsquo; with you,&rdquo; said Anne impolitely. &ldquo;I can tackle Ada with one hand
      tied behind my back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Sam agreed, &ldquo;you could, but you are not going to. Ada&rsquo;s my
      job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can be pig-headed as well as you, my lad,&rdquo; Anne menaced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; said Effie, conceiving perhaps that it was time for
      her to enter into this tragicomedy of rivalry in self-surrender. &ldquo;Sam&rsquo;s
      right. Ada does matter, and it is I who am the failure, I who have broken
      faith, I who was arrogant. I thought that I could bear a torch, and I can
      only bear a child. But I know now what I have to do. I can go away. I can
      disappear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Anne that this was serious because obviously it was a way
      out; but she thought it a way much more appalling in prospect than the
      plan she had proposed for herself of &ldquo;taking Ada on.&rdquo; She took alarm. In
      another than Effie it might have been heroics, but Effie&rsquo;s was not the
      stuff that mouths bravado. Anne granted that, and saw a tragic chasm yawn
      She signalled her alarm to Sam, who answered it with a glance which made
      appeal to her, whilst yielding nothing of his obstinacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you go away,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my mother goes with you. I&rsquo;ve meant that from
      the first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne nodded without enthusiasm. Certainly that was a solution and equally
      not the solution. It gave Sam to Ada, and Effie, it appeared, was not
      seeing it as a solution at all. There were strange possibilities, Anne
      thought, in this young woman, and she did not want them to be tested too
      far. Effie was not a talker, and when she said a thing she did not
      overstate. There was danger. Well, Anne was forewarned, and addressed
      herself in her most humorous, common-sense manner to laugh it out of
      court. One can deal with danger in worse ways than to apply to it the acid&mdash;ridicule.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her arms akimbo and surveyed Effie and Sam appraisingly. &ldquo;I
      dunno,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s a pin to choose between the three of us
      for chuckle-headed foolishness. We&rsquo;re all fancying ourselves as hard as we
      can for martyrs and arranging Ada&rsquo;s life for her. It hasn&rsquo;t struck any of
      us yet that Ada&rsquo;s likely to arrange things for herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And if Sam&rsquo;s impulse was to say gloomily: &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t likely at all,&rdquo; he
      repressed it when Anne&rsquo;s eye caught his, and said instead, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo;
       without knowing why he said it and without believing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flicker of a smile crossed Effie&rsquo;s face; Sam as conspirator struck her
      as crudely humorous. Anne saw the smile and understood, but brazened it
      out. &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; she said, defying Effie. &ldquo;Ada&rsquo;s a poor thing of
      a woman, but she&rsquo;s none beyond having a mind and speaking it. I was always
      one to take the short road out of trouble, so I&rsquo;ll go along to Peter
      Struggles&rsquo; now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; consented Effie, and Anne understood her to mean that the
      crisis, if one had impended, was postponed. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Effie, &ldquo;of course,
      I saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Which was, in its way, a challenge; it was, at any rate, to tell Anne that
      Effie knew what had been suspected of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne met it as a challenge. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were quite wrung, Mrs. Branstone,&rdquo; said Effie quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a
      coward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne was tying her bonnet-si rings, and found it convenient to look down.
      She preferred, just then, not to meet Effie&rsquo;s eye. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m
      overanxious,&rdquo; she mumbled in apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s no need,&rdquo; said Effie, a little cruel in her victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Sam the conversation seemed to have slipped into another dimension. He
      hadn&rsquo;t the faintest idea what they were talking about.

      CHAPTER XXV&mdash;WHOM GOD HATH JOINED
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>ETER Struggles
      walked into his tobacconist&rsquo;s and put his snuff-box on the counter. There
      was no need to state his requirements; in fact, he had not stated them for
      many years. Shopman and customer understood each other very well, and
      business came first; then if there was inclination, as there usually was,
      talk followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day, however, the shopman gaped at Peter in surprise, and made a
      half-turn of his head, so that he could see his calendar Wednesday was
      Peter&rsquo;s day for buying snuff with a regularity to which time had given the
      force of a tradition, and the tobacconist had even the habit of using
      Peter&rsquo;s visit as a reminder to a fallible memory that he must wind his
      clock. The calendar continued him in his belief that to-day was Thursday,
      and he felt sure that Peter had been in as usual on Wednesday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter had. Snuffing, of course, is a wasteful habit in any case, and a
      shaking hand misses the target more freely than a steady one; but, for all
      that, Peter, in his mental anguish, had consumed in one night the better
      part of his week&rsquo;s supply of snuff. The box was indubitably empty. He had
      not come to replenish it without some conscientious qualms&mdash;an
      allowance is an allowance&mdash;but he felt that life which comprised Ada
      in her present mood and did not comprise snuff, was beyond bearing. Ada
      was, it seemed, inevitable: he must mitigate Ada.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The usual, if you please, Thomas,&rdquo; he unusually said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Thomas, filling the box. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had a little accident?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An accident? Oh!&rdquo; Then the fitness of that guess struck him. &ldquo;Yes,
      Thomas, a little accident. By the way, do you know anything about
      divorce?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, I read the <i>Sunday Judge,</i>&rdquo; Thomas replied deprecatingly.
      &ldquo;Very human subject, sir, divorce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You find it so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take a lot of satisfaction in reading about my sinful
      fellow-creatures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite, quite,&rdquo; said Peter vaguely, and went out of the shop, leaving a
      puzzled salesman behind him. &ldquo;Forgot to pay, and all,&rdquo; thought Thomas.
      &ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;d grudge it if he didn&rsquo;t pay, only it&rsquo;s not like him. He looks
      sadly to day. The old boy&rsquo;s breaking up. Him and divorce! What does he
      want to worry his head about divorce for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter did not know that he had mentioned divorce, to his tobacconist. It
      would have shocked him if he had known. He spoke unconsciously, and
      listened mechanically to the man&rsquo;s reply, but he was, harrowingly,
      &ldquo;worrying his head&rdquo; about divorce. He took snuff in the street, an
      unheard-of occurrence, but it did not clear his aching brain of the
      fateful word &ldquo;divorce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ada had put it there too firmly in her stupid and invincible malignity.
      She had one aim&mdash;to do Sam the greatest injury she could. His offence
      was rank, and she demanded a proportionate revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had lived as a spinster for marriage and as a wife by marriage.
      Marriage was not a duty, but a state of beatitude, and she had walked in
      the faith of her grotesque illusion that her marriage was singularly
      blessed. It was childless, and the more blessed for that: there were no
      intruders on the perfect union of man and wife. It was illusion, and a
      wilder perversion of the truth than the ordinary self-deceiver can attain;
      but illusion is the breath of life, and she had fed on her deception till,
      like a drug-taker, she could not live without it. She had blazoned it
      abroad in a hundred drawing-rooms. If there were low-voiced colloquies of
      this or that affair, if it was hinted that men were faithless ever, Ada
      would grow superior and boast the flawless rectitude of Sam. These were
      things which happened to other people, who very likely deserved them, and
      could by no manner of means occur to her. She was not so sunk in
      imbecility as to deny that they did happen, and to people who were,
      nominally, married; but they were unsound people, insecurely married.
      There was a fundamental difference between their marriages and hers. She
      couldn&rsquo;t explain; it was too obvious for explanation. She was married, and
      these others, somehow, were married, yet not married. They had, through
      lack of merit, stopped short of the seventh paradise where nothing could
      shake consummate bliss. They were not as she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now she had to face the fact that the impossible had happened to her,
      and not only had it happened, but was known to have happened. That was
      where the blow struck home. She had publicly elaborated her case of
      absolute conviction, she had vaunted his faithfulness, the cardinal
      connubiality of Sam, and Miss Entwistle was spreading the news that she
      had been a doting fool! And she hadn&rsquo;t. She had not doted on Sam. She had
      not been infatuated with her husband, but with the idea of her husband
      which she had created and maintained. If only she had had the gumption to
      defy Miss Entwistle! If only she had concealed her belief in the story as
      successfully as she had hidden the fact that Sam had a separate room! She
      had been taken by surprise, she had admitted everything by default, and,
      worse, she had assured Mrs. Grandage that she would never see Sam again.
      She did not doubt, in spite of Mrs. Grandage&rsquo;s good-nature, that this
      little sequel to the story of Miss Entwistle was in rapid circulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was humiliated publicly, and, as she saw it, the one course open to
      her was to make Sam suffer a humiliation as drastic and as public as her
      own. Though it hurt her, he must pay for it; though she died, he must be
      punished and, sincerely, she expected it to kill her. She lived in a
      garden of lies, and life without the illusion of her marriage would be as
      impossible as life without the fragrance of her poisonous flowers to
      Rappaccini&rsquo;s daughter, but no matter for that. Ada must be revenged, and
      divorce, though it killed her, would be the greatest injury that she could
      do a politician and a pietistic publisher. She managed to square the
      circle, too. She was to die and make a murderer of him; she was to ruin
      his business and make a bankrupt of him; and at the same time she was to
      have the compensation of a handsome alimony. But perhaps vengeance is
      always irrational, and that is why it belongs to God.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dinned her word into Peter&rsquo;s ears with the merciless reiteration of a
      hurt and howling child. It was her first word and her last, and appeals
      based on religion shattered themselves against it as fruitlessly as the
      appeal to reason. What she had said she had said: and she had said
      &ldquo;Divorce.&rdquo; Alternatives did not exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Peter, divorce ranged itself with the abominations of the world, a
      man-made legal subterfuge to evade the law of God. There might,
      conceivably, be occasions when divorce was to be condoned as the
      comparatively little wrong which did a great right, and he tried very
      honestly to see Ada&rsquo;s as one of those heroic needs. He failed: he could
      not even see that Ada was hurt in soul, or in anything but pride. She was
      in a mood, not of spiritual revolt, but of peevish discontent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Small wonder that he snuffed prodigiously that night. He had his meed of
      suffering, and overcharged his small account with dreadful self-reproach.
      He, not Ada, and not Sam, was responsible for her violence and for the
      cause of it; he and the books upon his shelves; reading, his darling sin.
      He blamed himself for consenting too readily to their marriage. Sam, he
      had thought, would lead Ada: on what grounds had he thought it? What had
      he known of Sam&rsquo;s leadership&mdash;a prolix, fluent boy at the
      Concentrics? He had exchanged his daughter for peaceful, solitary evenings
      with his books&mdash;&ldquo;Self-seeker!&rdquo; he thought&mdash;and the exchange was
      to recoil upon him now. He had abandoned, after one harsh, undaughterly
      repulse, his attempt to show her that wearing a wedding ring was not the
      whole duty of woman&mdash;&ldquo;The sin of Pride,&rdquo; he thought&mdash;and had
      returned to browse amongst his books. Sam seemed a good fellow, too. There
      were those Classics, and the texts, and the prosperous old age of Mr.
      Carter, who, but for Sam, would certainly have ended his days in the
      workhouse. But, failing with Ada, he ought to have appealed to Sam....
      Yes, he ought to have taken a strong line with Sam, instead of letting
      Sam&rsquo;s worldly success dazzle him. Sam had seemed too big for Peter
      Struggles to grapple with&mdash;the sin of cowardice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it had come to this! Sam had broken the seventh commandment, and Ada
      wished to forget the words which Peter had read over them when he joined
      their right hands together, and said, &ldquo;Those whom God hath joined
      together, let no man put asunder.&rdquo; She commanded a divorce, and it was
      useless for Peter to insist, out of his small store of worldly wisdom,
      that divorce was not hers to command. Sam had not been &ldquo;cruel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her fury only doubled. Gone, vanished like the snows of long ago, was her
      painted idyll of domestic bliss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cruel?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s never been anything but cruel. I&rsquo;m black and blue
      with his atrocities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Very gently he tried to tell her that he did not believe it. &ldquo;We must not
      exaggerate,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exaggerate!&rdquo; she blazed. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you believe me till you see it? I&rsquo;ll go
      upstairs and strip. Come when I call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He soothed her down at that, seeing that she was capable of doing herself
      some signal injury to call in evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I want my divorce: get me a divorce.&rdquo; That was
      her simple demand of the priest who married her: it was why Peter took,
      unrepentantly, as much snuff in a night as he commonly took in a week, and
      why, with replenished stock, he continued next day to take snuff with a
      lavish hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It irritated Ada, though she had always associated Peter with a snuff-box,
      and the untidiness of the habit could not offend her, who was never
      offended by dirt, as any mechanical movement in another will irritate one
      whose nerves are ill-controlled. They had talked themselves to a
      standstill, and sat in moody silence, broken only by the deplorable sound
      of taking snuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked viciously at him. &ldquo;If you do that again, I shall leave the
      room,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, my dear,&rdquo; he said, although, really, it was a pleasant threat;
      but when he did it again, it was through pure absent-mindedness, and he
      was terribly distressed at his selfishness when Ada flung out of the room.
      He had the feelings of a child put in a corner as a punishment, and to
      relieve them he took snuff again. She heard him from the stair, and heard
      him immediately afterwards poking the fire; and she thought the loathsome
      self-absorption of men and their utter callousness to the anguish of
      sensitive women were proved beyond the possibility of doubt. She threw
      herself on the bed in her old room, alone in a friendless world.... The
      bed had a warm eiderdown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter poked the fire because it needed poking. It often did. The grate was
      one of those labour-making contrivances which must be periodically cleared
      of ash if the fire is to burn at all, and it was rarely cleared. The woman
      who &ldquo;did for&rdquo; Peter, did for him badly, and he was at the age when a man
      needs artificial warmth: a gaunt, shrunk figure as neglected as his house.
      Small wonder that, apart from his attachment to St. Mary&rsquo;s, he was still a
      curate. They had considered him for the living when his vicar moved some
      years ago, they had considered the little circle of rich parishioners who
      made an oasis of civilization in that savage place, and they had decided
      that Peter lacked the social graces. They had seen his mittens, his
      unfinished coat... they had seen him eat an orange: and he remained a
      curate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire was gone beyond the reach of his unscientific poking. That, too,
      often happened with a man who had the habit of standing by his bookshelf
      reading gluttonously, with his austere person frozen into a grotesque
      attitude, some book which he had not the patience to carry to the
      fireside: and he was now upon his knees making pathetically clumsy efforts
      to revitalize the flame when his inefficient housekeeper opened the door
      and showed Anne into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It eased the situation for them both. Anne indeed, was nervous, so nervous
      that she had walked three times past the door before she pulled the bell.
      She had a befitting awe of the priest, and a tremendous respect for the
      man. At Effie&rsquo;s, because the circumstances there were tense, it had seemed
      an easy thing to come to Peter&rsquo;s, but she had needed to call on her
      reserves of courage to keep her place on the doorstep after she had rung
      the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, however, when she came into the room and saw what he was at, she
      pushed him gently aside, and took the poker from his hand. She nursed the
      fire skilfully; she was with familiar things which gave her back her
      confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the trouble, she diagnosed it in a moment. &ldquo;That woman of yours is a
      slut,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll talk to her before I go. I reckon I&rsquo;ve the
      right, me and you being connections by marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him over her shoulder, and saw that he did not recognize
      her. How, indeed, should he? She had avoided Ada&rsquo;s wedding, and she was
      one of a large flock: a face, perhaps, but not a name to him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Anne
      Branstone,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Sam&rsquo;s mother; and I&rsquo;ll not have you blaming
      Sam for this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the fire?&rdquo; asked Peter vaguely, he was rather muddled by her brisk
      incursion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Anne, almost gaily; &ldquo;for the fat that&rsquo;s in the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She thought she had his measure now&mdash;the sort of a man who could live
      in a dirty room like this, with a choked ash-pan and fire-irons with the
      rust thick on them. But Peter was greater than that. She judged him by
      those of his surroundings which had significance for her, and not by books
      which expressed everything for him and nothing for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Branstone!&rdquo; he said, as if realizing now with whom he had to deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam&rsquo;s mother,&rdquo; she repeated, rising from a healthy fire; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve told
      you where not to put the blame. You can, maybe, think yourself of the
      right place to put it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he surprised her by saying; &ldquo;on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! Oh, if you want to go to the back of behind, you can blame Adam and
      Eve. But that&rsquo;s not what I meant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On me,&rdquo; he said again. &ldquo;I consented to this marriage. I sanctioned it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not come here to crow, but I&rsquo;ve the advantage of
      you in that. I did not consent,&rdquo; and her eye strayed involuntarily to a
      scar on her hand, memorial of the form of her dissent. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t consent
      because I knew they weren&rsquo;t in love. I told Sam I knew it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;you are worthier than I am, Mrs. Branstone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I knew love matters? There&rsquo;s nowt so wonderful in knowing that,
      and nowt so crafty in foreseeing that a marriage where there is no love is
      marred from start to finish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love matters,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;It matters all, for God is love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come to an agreement, you and me,&rdquo; she said appreciatively. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
      the same mind about the root of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a terrible business, Mrs. Branstone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m none denying it. It&rsquo;s a terrible thing for a man and wife to live
      together when love&rsquo;s not a lodger in the house; it&rsquo;s wrong, and the worst
      of wrong is that it won&rsquo;t stay single. Wrong&rsquo;s got to breed. But, there,&rdquo;
       she finished briskly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you what you know, and when all&rsquo;s said,
      there&rsquo;s nowt so bad that it&rsquo;s past mending.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ada wants a divorce,&rdquo; said Peter, and a sudden glint of triumph came into
      Anne&rsquo;s eye, only to vanish as quickly as it came. She had said, without
      believing it, that Ada might make arrangements, and this was to arrange
      indeed. It unmade the hollow marriage, it was a solution which really
      solved, it was a clean cut; and she wanted to glorify Ada, who was proving
      at the eleventh hour that she had the saving grace of common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter did a curious thing. He rose and took a book haphazard from his
      shelf, came back to his chair and opened the book. He did not read it, and
      he was not being rude, but this was an agitation beyond the reach of
      snuff. He tried to calm himself by resting his eyes on print.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne was not practised in the ways of bookish men, but, by strange
      insight, understood that Peter had gone to a book much as she went to his
      grate, to be soothed by its familiarity, and her rejoicing at his words
      came to an abrupt end. His action brought home to her, more than his
      horror-struck tone, whose significance she almost missed in her joy at
      Ada&rsquo;s practical solution, his loathing of divorce: and it seemed to her,
      quite suddenly, that what mattered most in all this business was that
      Peter should be happy about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It mattered more than Sam and Ada, and even more than Effie, that Peter,
      who was, so to speak, an old and sleeping partner, should be satisfied by
      their solution. She did not care if this was to per vert the values: the
      remnant of Peter Struggles&rsquo; life was of more importance than the young
      lives of the active members of the firm. And because she had a practical
      mind, and believed that one is happy in soul only when one is first happy
      in body, she was already thinking past their present problem: she was
      considering how the slut in Peter&rsquo;s kitchen could be replaced by her own
      housewifely self.
    </p>
    <p>
      She resolutely consigned that thought to the future, and returned to the
      question of to-day. Ada, wonderfully, wanted a divorce: but Anne required
      that Peter should be happy about it, and she perceived the
      incompatibility. She saw that juxtaposition could hardly be more crude. He
      was a priest, the priest who married them, and she wanted him to acquiesce
      contentedly in their divorce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wants a divorce, does she?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s more than Ada to be
      thought of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is, indeed,&rdquo; said Peter, thinking of his church.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; said Anne, thinking of him. &ldquo;If she gets one, does she
      plant herself on you again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He supposed so, unable to disguise his depression at the prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; she rubbed it in, &ldquo;you were well rid of Ada once. It&rsquo;s not in human
      nature to want her back again.&rdquo; She was thinking singly of his comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter, on his part, took her to imply that if he opposed a divorce it was
      for interested motives, that he could continue to be &ldquo;well rid of Ada.&rdquo; He
      saw with dismay that it was an interpretation which could reasonably be
      put on any opposition from him. He thought, in his humility, that it was a
      reasonable interpretation, whereas, Peter being Peter, it was a
      ludicrously unjust interpretation, and, of course, Anne did not make it.
      She had only stated as a fact that Ada at home prejudiced her father&rsquo;s
      comfort: and the comfort of Ada&rsquo;s father had become a matter which touched
      Anne Bran-stone nearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there are other people, too. There&rsquo;s Sam,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;and he is a
      desperate bad case. He has no love for Ada. He&rsquo;s hoisted his notion of his
      duty higher than a living love. He wants Ada to come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to say,&rdquo; mourned Peter, &ldquo;that the more he wants it, the less
      likely she is to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tried not to exult too openly at that. &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
      Effie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Effie!&rdquo; He spoke in scandalized protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, that&rsquo;s her name, and yon&rsquo;s just the tone of voice I had myself when
      I first heard of her. I want you to see Effie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; said Peter, and for a mild man his bitterness was remarkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I must show her to you,&rdquo; said Anne placidly, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;ll mean going
      back a bit and showing you other things as well. It&rsquo;ll mean,&rdquo; and she very
      much regretted it, &ldquo;showing you this.&rdquo; She held out her hand and pointed
      to the scar. &ldquo;When Sam told me he wanted to marry Ada, I came to see her.
      I saw what I saw, and I told him she&rsquo;d be the ruin of him. He didn&rsquo;t
      believe me, and I tried to make him see I meant it. I put my hand into the
      fire, and I thought to keep it there till he agreed with me, but he&rsquo;s
      stronger in the arm than me, and he got me away.&rdquo; She spoke without
      passion, in simple narrative which Peter found impressed him deeply. &ldquo;So I
      left him and earned my living, and all that. Sam married her, and the
      ruin&rsquo;s come, but it&rsquo;s not come suddenly. It&rsquo;s been coming all the time.
      I&rsquo;d date it back,&rdquo; she reflected, &ldquo;to the day when he fooled you about the
      &lsquo;Social Evil&rsquo; pamphlet. He did that because he wanted a rich husband for
      Ada.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter had nothing to say. If he had not known before that Sam had &ldquo;fooled&rdquo;
       him, he did not doubt it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it grew from that. He&rsquo;s made money because Ada wanted money, and
      after that it grew to be a bad habit. He made it then by writing lies
      about himself in the papers, and I don&rsquo;t know how he&rsquo;s done it since then,
      except that it has been by more lies. He began to fancy himself at
      politics. He wanted to be a crowing cock, and it didn&rsquo;t matter if he
      crowed on a dung-heap so long as he crowed. And Ada didn&rsquo;t care. He gave
      her money, and she didn&rsquo;t care. She didn&rsquo;t love, and he didn&rsquo;t love, and
      there&rsquo;s a thing you said just now that I&rsquo;ll remind you of. You said God&rsquo;s
      love. I&rsquo;ll leave it to you to name what it is when there isn&rsquo;t love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then love came to Sam. Effie came, and you say that God is love. Sam
      put it to me in another way. He said he&rsquo;d found salvation. Well, it&rsquo;s a
      big word, and I dunno. But I do know he found love and it changed him.
      He&rsquo;s done with politics, and he&rsquo;s done with crowing and with riches, too.
      Effie did that by the power of love, and there&rsquo;s another thing she did,
      that&rsquo;s marked yon lass for me as the finest, strangest woman in the width
      of the world. She gave him up and sent him back to Ada. Well, I&rsquo;ve heard
      of sacrifice before, and I&rsquo;ve done a bit that way myself, but give up a
      man she loved and teach him how to make a woman of his wife, and send him
      home to do it&mdash;it&rsquo;s more than I can rise to. And that is Effie
      Mannering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went home and he tried, and Ada laughed at him. She couldn&rsquo;t
      understand: there wasn&rsquo;t the one thing there that could make her
      understand: there wasn&rsquo;t love. And he gave up his politics that night she
      laughed at him, to leave himself free to tackle Ada. Now Ada&rsquo;s left him,
      and there&rsquo;s sum-mat else turned up as well. You can guess.&rdquo; He looked up
      sharply. &ldquo;Aye, that&rsquo;s it, and the rum thing is that it surprised them
      both. Their love&rsquo;s that sort of love, and I reckon there are folk would
      call it careless of them. I would myself nine cases out of ten, aye, and
      ninety-nine in a hundred, but not this case. This wasn&rsquo;t a case for care;
      it was a case of love. But a baby&rsquo;s coming to Effie, and you know&rsquo; as well
      as I do that none will ever come to Ada. I&rsquo;ve finished telling you about
      Effie now.&rdquo; There was a long pause and it seemed several times that Peter
      was about to break it, and each time changed his mind. All that he finally
      said in comment on Effie was, &ldquo;A lawless woman,&rdquo; and it might have been
      deduced from his tone that he did not condemn, if he could not,
      confessedly, admire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, lawless,&rdquo; Anne agreed, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s a law of lawless women and she
      has not obeyed it. She&rsquo;s not a breaker. She&rsquo;s a maker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter bowed his head. Perhaps he did not wish Anne to see what was written
      in his face. And he lacked conviction when he tried to speak again. &ldquo;Whom
      God hath joined&mdash;he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But God,&rdquo; Anne said, &ldquo;is love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw up his hands in a despairing gesture of surrender. &ldquo;I deserve to
      be unfrocked for this,&rdquo; he said, but he closed the book on his knee and
      took snuff violently. It marked the passing of a crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Anne, there mingled with her satisfaction at his consent a keen
      despondency at his unhappiness. She had both lost and won, and Anne took
      little pleasure in a mixed victory. She had not finished yet with Peter
      Struggles.

      They had not thought, when they came back to Marbeck at the turn of the
      year, that Marbeck could be better than before. They came hoping, they
      said, to recapture the old emotions, and brought Anne with them to show
      her their fairyland. They did not recapture the old emotions, because they
      were young emotions, a ferment like youth itself, and things were settled
      now. They seemed to look back from their equable security to a wild
      infancy of their emotion, a fumbling, frenzied, awkward age of love. Of
      course they looked back happily, from a place where things were happy and
      serene to one where things were happy and impetuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dale was full of wonder, with a wonder which now belonged unerringly
      to fact and had mellowed in reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Anne, it was a pretty place, but &ldquo;lonesome,&rdquo; and, amazingly to them,
      she chafed to leave it. Anne did not suffer holidays gladly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had extolled Anne, they had not thought it credible that she should
      fail at anything, and it ruffled them disturbingly to find her fail at
      this. They had planned eagerly and, indeed, generously to bring her with
      them to Marbeck&mdash;generously, because they wanted to be alone, and
      even Anne, owe her what they did and be she what she might, was an
      intruder. But they wanted her to share with them their wonderland. Marbeck
      was theirs, theirs intimately and alone, their holy place, and they could
      think of nothing finer, nothing which came more nearly to her deserts of
      them, than to initiate her to their secret worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      They made her free of Marbeck, relived their week for her as much as for
      themselves, showed her where this and that dear folly happened, took her
      to view-points whence she could see the tops of hills they climbed, using
      the landscape as the ground-plan of an ecstasy which they invited her to
      share, and were discomposed to find that Anne, plainly straining
      enthusiasm in their behalf, could only say of Marbeck, their Marbeck, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      sure it&rsquo;s very nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She damned with faint praise their enchanted valley in whose every tree
      they took by now as fierce a joy as if they had created it, and in despair
      they dragged her, as a last hope, to the very Holy of their holies, the
      top of Hartle Pike. If she failed them there, if she did not see the
      beauty and the grace, the penetrating significance and the absolute
      sanctity of Hartle Pike, then her greatness was lopsided, resulting, like
      a show chrysanthemum, from the atrophy of other possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a great day for the fells, when a frozen surface crushed
      elastically underfoot and kept one dryshod anywhere, and they walked in
      frosty, sun-kissed air, keenly exhilarating yet spicily warm. Snow capped
      the greater heights and seemed to clarify an atmosphere already clear, but
      the dales were free of snow and never more fit for walking than now when
      their boggy surface was dried up and roughened to the tread by crisp,
      granulated particles of frost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne granted to herself that if one must take a holiday, this generous
      activity made nearly a venial matter of it. To climb these slopes was
      almost as satisfying to her body as to wash a long flight of steps, and
      she reached the top feeling as pleasantly tired as if she had done half a
      day&rsquo;s charring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, she hadn&rsquo;t charred, and there was in fact nothing which needed
      charring, nothing but a cleanliness which positively irritated her. She
      itched to be doing something and there was manifestly nothing to do except
      to enjoy herself. And if Anne Branstone was not doing a job, she liked, at
      any rate, to know that her next job was around the corner. She began, for
      the first time in her life, to feel a friendliness towards dirt. In the
      midst of this sprawling insolence of triumphant cleanliness, she hankered
      for a little humanizing soot. She could have loved her life-long enemy,
      and he did not appear... it was not a bit like Manchester.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far to the west, beyond a barrier of gleaming snow, she saw a murky cloud
      of smoke where the foul boot of industrialism stamps on the Lakeland Coast&mdash;a
      message and a call. It spoke, to her of natural dirt in this great waste
      of unstained purity; it made her sick for home and the thing she had to
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie and Sam stood gazing at the hills, spell-hound by loveliness, and
      when they tore their dancing eyes away it was to look into each other&rsquo;s.
      They had no need of words: their eyes exulted in the burnished splendour
      of the scene, and with a doubled exultation each in the other&rsquo;s joy. Then
      Sam turned hopefully to Anne and saw that she was looking with a rapt
      intensity at the west. At last, it seemed, the hills had touched her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s yon?&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;yon smoke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face fell as he told her, but he saw that this explained Anne&rsquo;s
      failure. She had not relished Marbeck because she had not seen it. She had
      not been looking at Marbeck, but all the while at something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      And why, he questioned, why, now that things had so admirably arranged
      themselves, must Anne still live in thought in Manchester? There seemed to
      him to be no law, nothing which could conceivably distract her attention,
      nothing which had not with genial finality been neatly finished off. Of
      course they had stupid legal business to come, but that was well ahead
      and, in any case, was not to worry them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not, surely, be troubling about Ada. It was he who had made the
      trouble there, insisting that Ada was &ldquo;his job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He insisted to the point of almost literally forcing himself upon her in
      Peter Struggles&rsquo; house, and remembered now with a twinge that desolating
      interview, if interview it could be called, and its liberating end; how
      Ada had looked at him, and answered nothing to his abject and passionate
      appeals (he wondered how he could have made them, but he was despairingly
      sincere): how he had pleaded and apologized for the past and supplicated
      for the future, all in the mastering grip of his Marbeck faith, and how
      she had kept silent till she turned on Peter and told him she must leave a
      house which did not shelter her from the deadly insult of this man&rsquo;s
      presence. He remembered the good woman, Mrs. Grandage, who had carried Ada
      to a Hydro at Southport, and wrote to Peter that Ada seemed quite happy
      there, &ldquo;nursing her grievance like a child,&rdquo; and was looking for a house.
      He had found something mystifying about the intervention of Mrs. Grandage:
      good nature fortified by a bad conscience was his attempt to explain her
      attitude, but what emerged clearly from the letters she wrote to Peter was
      that Ada had no intention of returning to Manchester: and when he thought
      of Southport, he realized its quintessential rightness as her home. He had
      not shirked his job; he had eaten dirt before her in his anxiety to do his
      job; and he was not allowed. What she was she must remain, and Southport
      seemed the aptest place for her. &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; as Mrs. Grandage wrote, &ldquo;she mast
      have money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was not difficult, and the money might have come in many ways: it
      came actually in a way which Effie hated and Sam thought exquisitely
      right. It came through Stewart, that faithful ally of the publishing
      business in its early days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dubby was in Effie&rsquo;s room, &ldquo;which is where,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your brother has a
      right to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You keep that up,&rdquo; she smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the poor dog to get none?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is to have whatever he wants,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s going,&rdquo; he completed her sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Effie, not smiling now, and kissed him very simply to seal his
      brotherhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood silent for a moment, then, with a jerk of his head he, so to
      speak, cut his loss and turned to her with the frank confidence of their
      settled relationship. &ldquo;Now we can talk,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Tell me about old Sam.
      What are you going to do with him? And with his business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She evaded his first question. &ldquo;The business? Oh, he&rsquo;ll sell that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let me buy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what I think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only the dog, my dear. Do you know any Greek? There&rsquo;s a connection
      between being a dog and being a cynic. In certain circumstances, I&rsquo;d have
      thought with you to the crack of doom, but your brother&rsquo;s a cynic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Effie sadly. &ldquo;But he will always be my brother, Dubby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, Effie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That will keep me on the sweeter side of
      currishness. But a dog wants meat. You&rsquo;ll tell Sam I&rsquo;m to have the first
      refusal of that business. I&rsquo;ll scrape a syndicate together in a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the Stewart Publishing Syndicate, which now has dashing offices near
      Covent Garden, came to birth and Ada got her money. When Sam tried to tell
      Effie that his investments outside the business were ridiculously small,
      she had refused to be impressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the means of life that matters, Sam. It&rsquo;s living: it&rsquo;s the
      quality of life: it&rsquo;s what we do with life,&rdquo; she said, and Ada got the
      means.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be married in a year to a man from Liverpool,&rdquo; said Dubby, when he
      heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why Liverpool?&rdquo; asked Sam, and Dubby shrugged his shoulders. He thought
      Sam&rsquo;s question stupid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, Sam,&rdquo; Dubby said, &ldquo;have you and Effie any plans?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Effie, when Sam hesitated, but a brother&rsquo;s curiosity was not to
      be stifled like that, and Sam&rsquo;s face told her, too, how he had hung on her
      reply. She resented his anxiety, the proof that he had not dropped his
      calculating habit. They had not discussed the question of plans because
      she held there was no question to discuss, and Sam, she thought, deserved
      a little punishment for thinking otherwise. &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;we
      shall stay in Manchester and face the music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Sam blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we must give Mr. Verity his revenge,&rdquo; she teased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it can&rsquo;t hurt me now I&rsquo;m out of politics,&rdquo; he said, confessing by his
      tone that it would hurt him very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will please him, though,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d... I&rsquo;d thought of going to America,&rdquo; he ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;America!&rdquo; scoffed Dubby. &ldquo;<i>O sancta simplicitas!</i> America&rsquo;s not El
      Dorado, Sam. El Dorado&rsquo;s been found. I&rsquo;d even say it&rsquo;s been found out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are big things in America,&rdquo; Sam defended his idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a matter of fact, Dubby,&rdquo; said Effie, silencing him, &ldquo;we shall go to
      Marbeek for a little while. It&rsquo;s a good place to begin from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that a great contentment came to Sam. They were to go to Marbeek;
      they were to begin; and he no longer questioned what. He made no hard and
      fast surrender of his will, but recognized the fact, not for the first
      time, that when Effie made a decision it had a shining rightness. Perhaps
      she had retreated from her first decision of Marbeck, but, if so, Anne
      helping him, he had retreated with her; and they went to Marbeek now, not
      to end, but to begin, and to begin together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reflecting on it all, he could not see the blemish. He couldn&rsquo;t, for the
      life of him, make out why Anne was not content.
    </p>
    <p>
      He half explained the valley&rsquo;s failure to enchant her when he perceived
      that she had not really looked at it. At what, then, could she be looking?
      And how could she, how in the name of beauty was it possible for anyone to
      pick out from all that noble amphitheatre of the hills the one
      smoke-clouded spot?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he cried in downright exasperation, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you happy here?&rdquo;,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be happier in Manchester,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Yon smoke&rsquo;s too far away to
      taste. Aye, I think I&rsquo;ll leave you here and go to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not going back to Madge&rsquo;s&mdash;to the work in other people&rsquo;s
      houses, I mean. That&rsquo;s surely over now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, you&rsquo;ve done with work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She eyed him grimly. &ldquo;Not till I&rsquo;m dead, my lad,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you tell me what you&rsquo;re thinking of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;of yon slut in Peter Struggles&rsquo; kitchen. I&rsquo;ll
      have her out of that tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at Effie, and then looked again. He fancied he had surprised a
      little smile on Effie&rsquo;s face and looked twice to make sure. And when he
      looked he found that Effie was looking back at him in the wise, humorous
      way that he had come to know so well. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; was what she seemed
      to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he did see. He saw that it was not Manchester, but a man in
      Manchester; not the woman in Peter Struggles&rsquo; kitchen, but the man in
      Peter&rsquo;s parlour who interrupted his mother&rsquo;s vision of the Marbeck hills.
      She lost their beauty in a greater beauty of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t be incredulous,&rdquo; said Effie&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to Anne. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go down to the Inn at once,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and you
      shall catch the train this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A quick look passed from Anne to Effie, from which they both excluded Sam.
      It almost seemed that Anne was asking Effie for support, and that Effie
      understood and nodded imperceptibly. And if Anne had seriously doubted,
      her doubts were dissipated by a look which told her that, where she was
      concerned, Effie believed in the feasibility of anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing at Marbeck became Anne Branstone like her leaving it. &ldquo;Why,
      mother, how young you look!&rdquo; he cried when she came downstairs to the
      trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as well,&rdquo; said Anne, meeting Effie&rsquo;s eye over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after she had gone, and so pat upon her going as to be hardly
      decent, life flamed for them ungrudgingly. There was something quite
      impudently callous about the haste of it, as if life pulled a face behind
      the older generation and turned lightheartedly to burn more ardently for
      them. But Anne, and they knew it, would not have thanked them to be sorry
      for her. She had gone to Peter Struggles, who needed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They could not now resume the half amphibious life of their autumn days,
      but the air itself from the snow-clad fells had all the stimulation of a
      bath. It cleansed and healed by touch and heightened their well-being till
      they moved in radiant exhilaration, now clamant at the joy of it, now dumb
      before its wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happy themselves, they were the cause of happiness in others, not
      self-contained in joy, but effervescing to the old black-beamed kitchen of
      the Marbeck Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had, as Sam cannily observed, the advantages of a private room at an
      hotel without paying for it&mdash;and abrogated them. In the autumn they
      had isolated their joy from others: now it brimmed from them and affected
      all the people of the Inn, making the long nights short. Good listeners
      were a godsend to the Dale in winter, and the shepherds, dropping from
      heaven knew how far, found a rare satisfaction in telling this attentive
      audience tales of the fells, of sheep wanderers that strayed as wide
      afield as Derbyshire, of dogs that ran amok and ravaged the flocks they
      ought to tend, of the epic Beast of Ennerdale, of the legends of John Peel
      and all the sagas of the Lakes. It needed little to make these dalesmen
      happy, nothing beyond a patient ear for a slow, rambling narrative&mdash;a
      long chain strung with pearls of racy episode&mdash;or an hour of Effie at
      the piano, when the dalesmen disappointed her by knowing no ballads, but
      having, instead, a sound acquaintance with the latest music-hall songs
      stacked in the cupboard at the Inn. In here, in the smoke room, they were
      knowing wags, in the kitchen they were themselves, talking shop, and
      therefore interesting. Effie and Sam preferred them in the kitchen,
      telling their slowly-moving tales, to seeing them in their smoke-room
      mood, imitating badly a thing not worth the imitating. But, in either
      room, they helped them to be happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well coated they would go each night from the tobacco-laden air of the
      kitchen down the road to the bridge over Marbeck Force. A great peace
      brooded there. Even the stream ran softly now when all the surface water
      of its gathering ground was frozen hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood there on the bridge while the moon rose over Hartle Pike and
      scattered silver on the snow. Great shadows leaped to instant birth below
      the Pike whose comely top was one black silhouette against the brightened
      sky, and the beauty of the valley, seen by day with an almost Alpine
      harshness, mellowed in the moonlight to a subtle luminosity. Behind them
      were the lights of the friendly Inn; near by the low church tower saluted
      God amongst the pines, and all around them spread the lustrous radiance of
      the moon-flushed Dale.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the hundredth time he restrained his impulse to repeat his words,
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll build a tabernacle here,&rdquo; and Effie read his thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re making the good beginning here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re practising and I
      think we grow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We grow in happiness,&rdquo; he said, which he thought good argument for
      staying at Marbeck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. We grow in happiness. We shall have outgrown Marbeck soon. We shall
      have grown a sturdy happiness that can withstand the towns. It might
      withstand Manchester and I think it will. To love, to work, to look for
      other people&rsquo;s strength and not for other people&rsquo;s weaknesses: that is to
      be happy, Sam. And happiness counts more than all. It roots and then it
      spreads. It spreads. Infection isn&rsquo;t only of disease, infection is of
      happiness and youth. There&rsquo;s too much age, too many men and women in the
      world who have forgotten love. We have to build, and build on happiness.&rdquo;
       They gazed at the unguessed future through the silent night. God knows
      that there was work ahead for them to do!
    </p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the
Foundation&rdquo; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; appears, or with which the
phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you&rsquo;ll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

other than &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation&rsquo;s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state&rsquo;s laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
